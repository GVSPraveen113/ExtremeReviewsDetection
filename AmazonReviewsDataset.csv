B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"Did not checked wifi range, as we do not use wifi in our home, to minimize radiation. Everything is wired. According to our use case, the router works well, no problem at all. Yes, once or twice it has hanged and has to be restarted but that problem is there with every brand. I have also used netgear and cisco, and at times they also have to be restarted. Overall, this is a good router."
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Effective Gigabit Router,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"Real gem of a router that gives very strong and speedy wifi signal to the entire house. Very easy to install and the Tether App is simply superb and intuitive and gives good account of connected devices. Was using D-Link DIR 615 for ages. Upon switchover, the speed went up by 250 %. A must buy for effective wifi cover throughout the house"
B07GVR9TG7,Ruby yadav,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good range wifi Gigabit router,Reviewed in India on 18 August 2020,This is really a nice budget router from TP-link. Works super fast in 5Ghz if your wifi element is within a 100 mts range. Otherwise the the 2.5 GHZ has a good range of more than 500mts and has a good range even when separated by two walls. Installation was very simple and even a non-techie can do it with the simple instructions provided.
B07GVR9TG7,Arjun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Major flaw in limiting bandwidth for individual connections,Reviewed in India on 13 January 2020,Over all the device is good. It delivers the speed that it advertises however there is a major flaw.    There is not option to limit the bandwidth for a device. You cannot even limit the bandwidth for guest network.    I am on V2 of firmware. Hopefully some future update can add this feature. My old Rs1000 Mi router had these features.
B07GVR9TG7,Kannan Kasturirangan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice budget buy if you are upgrading to 5GHz routers for first time,Reviewed in India on 3 December 2019,"I used a stock ISP provided router for my FTTH connection. Unfortunately the ISP routers usually are not very high specifications. Most only support 2.4 GHz band which has a lot of interference and provide very low speeds and so I bought this router for an upgrade.        If    1. You have a high speed connection (> 50 Mbps)    2. Your main router has a ethernet port (preferably gigabit ethernet)    3. You are not getting more than 30-35 Mbps on WiFi, even when standing near your router        You should go for this router. I have a 100 Mbps internet, but on my old 2.4GHz router, I hardly received 40 Mbps over WiFi. With this router running on 5 Ghz band, I am able to get full 100 Mbps speed, so it was well worth the money spent. (2.4 Ghz on this router is still same speed as my old router)        In case you already have a 5Ghz router and a higher speed connection (like 1 Gbps or so), you might want to go for a higher end router, because this router will max out at ~300-400 mbps."
B07GVR9TG7,Adity Raj,3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing value for money!,Reviewed in India on 2 March 2021,Absolutely great value for money considering it's a dual band Gigabit router. This is the latest V2 version of the router which is manufactured this year (2019). Wi-Fi coverage is excellent horizontally but not so great vertically. Both the bands perform great in range.        I've a 250Mbps ACT FIBERNET connection and I get full speeds since it's a Gigabit Router.
B07GVR9TG7,Viresh G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super 150 Mbps speed!!,Reviewed in India on 12 December 2020,"Super 150 Mbps speed under 5Ghz Wi-Fi mode, initially I bought AC 1200 C5 but it has two issues;    1. Signal strength was not able to penetrate two walls.    2. Each day during the night mostly it gets hanged and needs to be rebooted.        But Since, I am using the C6 AC1200 I haven't faced any such issue. Also, I was pretty confused between A6 and C6 but after doing deep research I realized that C6 is slightly better than A6. I bought it for 2198 during the prime sale."
B07GVR9TG7,Snehasis Mukherjee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Router in this price range,Reviewed in India on 30 September 2019,"This is one of the best WIFI router that I've used.    Dual band is working great on the new and old technologized products.    The speed is great across devices. So far connecting 5 devices including mobile, laptops and IP camera. And a smart TV        Have to check the One mesh technology. Will be posting the review post after implementing the with Extender."
B07GVR9TG7,Amit Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Singal strength is too weak even below than singal antenna,Reviewed in India on 26 October 2020,"The  company is just fooling by showing 4 antenna. Actually its signal strength is even poor than single antenna. I have 100 mbps fiber connection , the speed comes down to merely 15 mbps in my adjoining room and no singal when come to roof. My previous router giving me almost full speed in all space at home but keep hanging so i have to go for this router but seriously i am very disappointed from this router. Not at all recommended. A third router and very cleverly  no return option which you will undersrand why."
B07GVR9TG7,Vijayavel Nadar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,Reviewed in India on 14 December 2020,Easy to setup and install. Does the job. The range is good for the 2 GHz and can be better or the 5GHz . But it good to get the full download speed from high speed internet service form Hathway or ACT.    Nice design.    Could have added supported a USB    Overall a good product

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product. Worth purchase.,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"I purchased this wifi modem 2 months ago wherein it's working properly. The signal is very strong upto 10m, you'll get signal and also there is no issues found as of now with this router, so I never called their tech support for assistance. Also, the installation was very easy wherein we'll find all the info in a manual. Worth purchase."
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good for 1500 sq feet flat,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"I m using  this router since last 3 to 4 days, i would like to say some point.        1) look wise it is very cool.    2) speed is very good in both 2.4 n 5 gh mode.    3) signals was very good no issues till date.    4) easy to setup very good firmware.    5) range is not up to the mark        Over all if u want to bye a good dual band router and your flat or house is upto 1500 sq feet then go for it else try for other.        Amazon deliver it in one day which is grt in this pandemic situation."
B07GVR9TG7,KISHORE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Working perfectly since past 1 year. Its a great router.,Reviewed in India on 10 November 2021,Got this product last year in Feb. Its a great product with a decent coverage. Haven't faced any connectivity issues till date. Can connect multiple devices.        5 GHz band provides better speed but its range is short.    2.4 GHz provides better range but the speed is really bad. Its hardly 50 mbps.        Overall I am satisfied with this TP-Link Archer AC1200 Archer C6 router.
B07GVR9TG7,Subhankar sadhu,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Router but 5G range is too less,Reviewed in India on 31 July 2020,"I have upgraded from Archer C50 to this one. I  have a 300mbps connection and receiving a committed speed of 300mbps.        There is one problem I feel is that the range of 5Ghz is too less. (few steps away :) )  apart from this everything is working as expected.        Also remember that most of TP-link routers are not wireless repeater enabled mode. They come up with route mode/access point mode (which is wired repeater mode). So, when you decided to uprade your router and want to use the old one as a wireless repeater, then it's a problem"
B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,No bandwidth control which is basic. Returning this,Reviewed in India on 28 December 2021,What a worst thing ever. This is highly rated and doesn't even provide basic bandwidth control feature. Even guests are accessing my data at such high speeds. No limit control. Mercusys mw305r had lot of features. I'm going to return this.    No support available in India
B07GVR9TG7,Niranjan Reddy Nare,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best dual band router in the market,Reviewed in India on 9 June 2020,"The new design looks cool. All the features are working well, Super easy to setup through the app itself. I am using 100mbps plan, and it gives pretty decent speed. Best part is - it has only one name for both connection, and automatically it will connect u to the faster conn. Just go for it. Best 1200mbps dual band router."
B07GVR9TG7,Girish,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Will wow you, for 2 months. At least in my case.",Reviewed in India on 20 May 2021,"Great product....for 2 months.    Great signal coverage. I used to get signal in any corner of the house. But then suddenly it stopped working. As shown in the video the lights went dull for some reason and the device stopped working. Trying to reach tech support, but in vain."
B07GVR9TG7,Pratim Pramanik,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product worked OK for 20 months and suddenly WIFI is not working,Reviewed in India on 29 May 2021,"I bought this in Oct'18 and overall performance was OK. However, after 20 months, WIFI suddenly not working (unable to connect to clients most of the time, even if it connects speed drops to very low like 'single digit' mbps when my connection is 250mbps). Tried various options as suggested in TP-Link support site, but nothing worked. Surprisingly (in a bad way), I had purchases TP-Link Wifi PCIE card which also had WIFI issues within a year and I had to throw it out and purchased another vendor's WIFI card.        Very disappointed that you bought this for around INR 25K and it suddenly breaks. Its not worth to buy TP-Link products as I had two TP-Link products that had quality issues (particularly WIFI related)."
B07GVR9TG7,Sunil Desetti,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good 5Ghz perf with a USB port.,Reviewed in India on 24 May 2021,"My Setup:    BSNL fiber 200Mbps connection.    Syrotech fiber modem LAN2 GE port to TP-Link AC1200 (V3) WAN.        Ethernet Speed:    Always 230Mbps even with a 20m cable and a ethernet coupler.        2.4Ghz Wifi:    Never exceeds 60Mbps and range is decent like every router. But my old N300 can reach 80.        5Ghz Wifi:    Speed is consistent at 220Mbps when signal strength is good. Range is slighty less than 2G but can cover the adjacent rooms with full strrength. Getting 26Mb/s on Steam.        USB 2.0:    Takes 15sec to setup and appear in your network. Supports FTP, SMB & UpnP. I enjoy USB content on my Firestick via VLC player SMB. Tested with 2TB and 4TB drives.        I don't use NAT & VPN. Upload speed is inconsistent with my ISP so not mentioned.        Pros:    •Super easy to setup.    •Good 5Ghz performance.    •USB port works like a charm.    •Tether app is good but slow.    •Router settings page is user friendly & supports turning of LEDs.        Cons:    •Takes 1.5min to boot up and get internet ready. (My cheap tenda router instantly connects to internet).    •2.4Ghz will be worse than your old N300 router.    •No easy wireless repeater (I don't use much but my crap tenda have this)."
B07GVR9TG7,PC,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good Router,Reviewed in India on 24 June 2020,Good TP Link router with easy interface to connect.Bought from Appario Retail Private Ltd    1: It can be wall mounted    2: 2.4 GHz Radio Frequency; 5 GHz Radio Frequency are excellent no signal drop    3: You get latest firmware and V2 router instead of V3    4: Easy to configure router with app    5: After installing this router i can see download and upload speed difference.    6: It has WAN port so your local ISP will work on it not BSNL as this is not a modem.    7: It has bandwidth management  and 1 USB port for HDD connection and not Dongle.    Will use for some moths and rewrite review as i have old TP link router single antenna which was ON 24/7 since 4 years and still going good.

Connected 4 phones and 3 laptops at a time played UHD videos without lag.    Really worth for the price.
B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,this is better than the Airtel Wifi Router,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,I was not getting full strength in my room and my airtel router was in the hall. i kept this router next to the existing router connected via ethernet cable.Now i am getting full coverage in entire house. Earlier in my tv i was getting 80-100 Mbps speed and now i am getting 170-200 mbps speed. I am really impressed with this router. I am using firestick
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,What a Beast !!!,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"It was time to replace my dlink n300 router as it had started playing up. Changed to C6 after contemplating and comparing a lot of models. Models which were in the race were Tenda ac1200 and Tplink c1200 along with Tplink c5.    (1) Tenda's interface seems to be buggy with a lot of spelling errors and lack of good after sales support as per the reviews tilted the scale in Tplink favour. Among the three listed models, this one seems to be the latest and a hot favourite of a lot of online reviewers. Hence, a decision was made.        (2) The setup was a breeze. Took me literally 2-4 minutes to set it up and it was blazing away. The companion app is an amazing add-on .        (3) Mi-mo is an advanced technology which helps if you have a lot of devices trying to connect with the router.        (4) It is a dual band router. Remember that 2 ghz offers you great range but slower speed and 5 ghz has amazing speed but low  coverage range. I have a 75 Mbps connection. On a wireless connection, I am getting 45 Mbps on 2.4 ghz and 70 Mbps on 5 ghz, if I'm sitting close to the router. The speed does decrease a little in the next room but barely noteable. Now comes the best part , I'm getting full signal bars on 5 ghz in my bedroom which is approx 20 feet away from the router. I have connected my bedroom firetv on 5 ghz and now able to play 4k resolution videos without buffering pauses. To give you an example - i was able to download Asphalt 9 which is 1.82 gb on my One plus 6t in about 7 minutes i think. My entire house is covered well with either of the two bands. Full marks on this !        (5) Delivery was a breeze . Received the router within a day.        Conclusion- Go for it without a doubt if you have an above 50 Mbps connection and want a good speed with amazing coverage. It was my first day and i am 200% satisfied with the performance. Will need to gauge it's performance over a period of time to see how it fares.    Please upvote if my review was of some help to you."
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dual band 5GHz performance,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"I bought this router 3 days ago and here are my observations.    1. Item was delivered on time and in good condition.    2. Installation instructions were straight forward and it was easy to install and get the router to work.    3. I had enabled both the bands, 2.4 and 5.    4. Both of the bands perform well. I use cable connection (ACT) and it works well.    5. There is an issue with 5GHz though. I have seen complaints about signal dropping etc. What I have observed with 5GHz connection is that when we move further and further way from the router and if there are too many blocks like walls etc, then, the signal becomes poor. This is an inherent problem with 5G and not with the router. Otherwise, 5G works good.,    So far no issues and I will observe for a month to see if there are any issues that crop up.        Updated on 15th May 19:    Please note that for 5G to be effective, the client device like a phone or a laptop should be capable of 5G type radio communication. So, pls check the same before deciding to use 5G band."
B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Complete Package,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"I have BSNL Ftth 60Mbps connection in my home.. I Upgraded to this Router from Dlink Dir-816 upon the suggestion from BSNL. Now i'm getting full 60mbps both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. The range is also very good. Even in weakest point of the home i.e after crossing 4-5 walls and a floor, i'm getting 30mbps on this router where previously getting 2mbps on Dlink. It also has gigabit port. It supports speeds above 100mbps.    Overall a good router with awesome range and speeds. Worth the money."
B07GVR9TG7,Avinash Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bad and Misleading product,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2021,"I have this router for a while now. I bought it to cover my wifi requirements in my duplex house.    Installed in my study room first floor, the signal strength was never good enough to provide uninterrupted internet to my TV ands security system (though the router is placed a floor above with ample of open space) so had to pair with another router to cover ground floor.    Signal strength is decent in primary room (study room) but half when comes to bed room, next room on same floor.    Also you might have to reboote it once I a while to nudge it!    Summary- Not a good product, does not cover what it claims. At best OK for a small flat with two rooms."
B07GVR9TG7,Saq,5.0 out of 5 stars,TP-link and customer support/ warranty are antonyms.,Reviewed in India on 8 December 2019,"I ordered this router the first thing after amazon started delivering post lockdown. The product performed well. Delivered the mentioned speed and has a decent (if not better) coverage area. Enough to suffice a sub 1800 sq. feet apartment (Walls and objects impact greatly). If however, your house is bigger, I recommend a higher power router.        In my case, the router just stopped working one fine evening and the Customer Support is so damn pathetic, every time I call them, it takes me 20 min to connect to a Customer Care Rep when I register for warranty related issues. When I do, I have to explain them the whole thing with details every single time (no, they do not keep a record), after which they say they'll send you a mail but somehow always forget to. It's been more than 10 days and 4 calls. No responce. Egregious service!        In conclusion, please buy a product from a company who gives a damn about their customers.    (Pst pst, D-link)"

B07GVR9TG7,Arnab,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice item for ACT, tplink support is pathetic",Reviewed in India on 10 October 2019,First item delivered had some issues with wifi. Got a replacement. Works great with act fiber.    Getting 122mbps on 5ghz and around 60 on 2ghz    Theater app works great. Easy to setup and monitor connected device. And assign priority to the connected ones..        Tech support is pathetic. Tplink support - reaching them out itself is a difficult task and the support guys are bad. No enough knowledge on networks.. Tplink should work on it.
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not give good connection,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,Does NOT do its job. 2.4 Ghz connection completely unstable.    I am getting range of about 2 signals in a bedroome that is around 30 feet away from the router but no internet. Otherwise the 5ghz one is giving fine speeds. But I did not expect the 2.4 ghz connection to have drops and I am experiencing some drops in the network from time to time. The MIMO is not clearly visible.        Very bad router. No range in the next room. Completely useless. Not once am I able to stream video content hotstar/netflix etc. I am using an old single band router.        Edit1 :    This is bullshit from amazon. adding the reviews of many tp link routers together. Confusing the consumers into buying bad products.

B07GVR9TG7,Sandeep Bhor,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not recommended,Reviewed in India on 2 October 2018,"TP link ho gaya hai pagal..    Completely different product from C6 and it's written on box also it's C6. Tho in actuals this product resembles A6...    I had ordered C6.  But what I got is a product which is A6 in look wise. Totally confused with this mystery. Returning it .        Tho I tried to install it., But speeds aren't upto mark. Supports one mesh that's written on box., may be coz of which speed at 2.4Ghz is v poor.        Don't Buy. Not recommended. They will send a completely different product which isn't a oh la la product 😂        Update : 1.03.21    returned and received the same model again ..    To solve the mystery i opened Tplink webpage .    what i have been send is C6 Ver 3.20 . design is exactly same to A6. This doesn't support Mu- Mimo although its written on box that it supports. Instead it supports One mesh which i guess isn't helpful to many people unless you have a  existing mesh device already installed.    what they have displayed here in C6 Ver 2.0 but they are no longer selling it ( only old stock)         i will not recommend this C6 Ver 3.20. speed are vary .. in 2.4Ghz it drops to 15 mbps even if you are just 1 feet away from router. in 5Ghz it works good .. my plan to 150 Mbps and it reaches easily to 140 Mbps .    decide accordingly .        Thank You."

The 5 Ghz channel keeps working as expected. This is not a one-off case, this issue is reported by lot of people in last 1 year and no firmware upgrade has been able to solve it.

B07GVR9TG7,Dr RAVI H B,2.0 out of 5 stars,TPLink AC1200 Dummy!,Reviewed in India on 3 July 2020,"Unfortunately, the ISP technician was available to install this router after the 10 day return window had closed. Switched on to discover it switched off immediately. This happened repeatedly. TP Link customer care confirmed it was a software error on a brand new router.  That says a lot about product testing at TPLink!!"
B07GVR9TG7,Ankush,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great router for plans 750 Mbps or less and home area is 1200 sq.ft or less,Reviewed in India on 26 February 2021,"Before I describe the router and its benefits I need to describe our home and it’s area and also the Internet plan we have. We live in a 2 BHK apartment with approx 1200 sq ft and have lived here for 4 years. When we moved in we took an ACT incredible plan with 150Mbps download speed which ACT then upgraded to ACT lightning plan with 250 Mbps free of cost a year later and now we have ACT advance received as a free upgrade almost a year ago. This one is supposed to give us about 400 Mbps but we have only been receiving 150 to 170 Mbps around about. So I understood that I need a router upgrade from my old D-link dual band to another, and that’s  when I found out about Archer C6. After reading and watching reviews comparing it to A6 and Tenda AC10, and also consulting with our ACT technician I decided to go for the C6. It’s been 10 days and it’s been a better streaming, downloading and WFH experience throughout the home.    Though the C6 has dual bands, you can set to autodetect the faster band depending on your location of in your home.  For us, we found out that C6 covers the entire home with the 5G band itself as I could receive approximately 300 Mbps in the living room and 200 Mbps in the bedroom next to it and about 100 to 170 Mbps in our Master bedroom and the bathroom attached which are behind 2 walls. And when I tested the 2.4 G Hz in these farthest locations, it only gave me 5 to 15Mbps which means if this band has to give me better speed , I had to farther away i.e I need to step out of my apt and walk the corridor towards the elevator and check if the 2.4 G Hz works there. But that’s a curiosity for another day but I hope this helped youunderstand the range this router gives and also with the MU-MIMO technology, my wife and I aren’t complaining about signal loss to each other anymore.    After this upgrade I also understood that that I need to ask ACT to upgrade the RJ45 cable that connects from the wall. That will help us boost the signal to another 50 tom70 Mbps which will take our speed to about 370Mbps and this router is very much capable of that since since its top speed in 5G is up to 867 Mbps and 2.4 G is up to 300.    P.S: please have the router connected through a UPS and not directly to the power source since power fluctuations and outages are common in India, the ups protects the router and helps us have a seamless work/browsing experience when the apt changes the power source to “backup power” when there is power outage in your area"
B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Go for it,Reviewed in India on 17 October 2020,"The router works perfectly fine on both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz band. The network coverage of the router is also excellent. I have connected my smart tv to the 5Ghz band and the speed i get on it is superb and the shows/movies on netflix, disney+ and prime video which support 4K play absolutely fine without any issues or buffering."

B07GVR9TG7,Ranjan J Kamath,1.0 out of 5 stars,A cheaper router but doesn't have a good range,Reviewed in India on 27 August 2019,"I bought Archer C1200 to replace MI 3c router (which inspite of providing very good coverage across a 2500 Sq. ft. house, didn't let me leverage the complete connection speed of 150 Mbps).    The router in question does provide both 2.4 and 5 Ghz connectivity, as expected the range of 5 GHz. isn't much, but what really disappoints me is the range of 2.4 GHz, it is poorer than what Mi 3C provides.    Mi's signal inspite of being around -60 to -70 dBM does provide a speed of at-least 10 Mbps out of the incoming 100 Mbps( at a distance of 15 ft, not in straight like and behind walls), but very surprisingly TP Link C1200's speed drops to < 2 Mbps or the connection is lost.        For this reason i had to return it. For large homes(2500 Sq. ft. + ) this wouldn't be a good choice, even to be used as a repeater ."

Network coverage is poor as i am not getting network in the areas where I used to get previously with also an old TP link router.        I would recommend going for Rs1900 version which has same features as this one except MIMO which is of no use of us anyways.

B07GVR9TG7,AC7090,1.0 out of 5 stars,Internet speed drops to 10% of total speed after days due to serious firmware issue.,Reviewed in India on 18 March 2018,"The devices have serious issues with their firmware. The internet speed over LAN and WIFI drop to less than a quarter of total speed and this is frequent. Changing the firmware to old version solves the issue for sometime but again the internet  drops and constant followup with customer care makes you feel that buying this was a bad choice. Recently the whole tp link forum is flooded with internet speed deteriorating issues. I would strongly recommend a different  brand. This is the 3rd time in 6 months, like how many times do you want to reset the device, change firmwares and keep contacting the customercare."

But now is the age of optical fiber internet, so we need a capable router. This TP Link Archer C6 perfectly does the job. I upgraded and immediately started getting  110mbps plus download speed (with W740N i was  getting around 35mbps). I am happy with the purchase. Setup is also super easy. Worth the price."
B07GVR9TG7,Sandeep,1.0 out of 5 stars,Outdated product!!,Reviewed in India on 2 November 2020,"There is nothing great about this product. I upgraded from TP link wr41n and believe me there is no increase in the wifi signal coverage at all. Although I must say the 5g speed is a charm but the vicinity is too small. The usb port and connectivity is outdated. You need to tweak windows machine to support it. Ipad would not accept it at all, directing to buy a paid third party software. If you are looking buy this for USB Nas, I would suggest buy a separate wireless usb hub instead.    One more interesting observation, when you have one or two signal bar, the internet would not work at all."
B07GVR9TG7,Debangshu Manna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2021,"Has the dual band. 2.4 hz and 5Hz frequency. Range is fantastic and on days when my internet provider sticks to their SLA, the speed test shows 100 MbPS + speed on the 5 Ghz frequency. On the 2.4 Hz frequency, it shows around 50 - 60 MbPS range.    One thing to note in the primary and guest configuration of router is that your google chrome would connect only to primary and will not connect to guest.    Its super easy to install as well.. No hassles.    Am extremely happy with this purchase"
B07GVR9TG7,Sachin Nayak,2.0 out of 5 stars,Read this if you are planning to buy,Reviewed in India on 30 June 2020,"After using it for a month, I'll write my honest review, I ordered it a month ago, everything seemed fine, except for one problem (keep on reading), I thought this particular piece is faulty, and since there was no return option and it could only be replaced, I ordered a replacement, within 2-3 days I got a fresh new piece.        But, same problem again, the problem in both the routers is that it loses 2.4Ghz channel while the 5Ghz channel is happily running, so there was obviously nothing wrong in my Internet connection, all of a sudden you'd lose Internet, while my Android TV which is connected to 5G band is going on smoothly, after some research, I saw a few articles which said that if there are a lot of wifi networks around your wifi then sometimes due to interference  you can lose this channel. however, I never faced this problem in my old Netgear router. I tried all suggested workarounds but the problem continued in my original router as well as in the replacement that I got.        So, I'm living with this problem, thankfully it's not very painful, so far what I've observed is that you lose Internet once in two days, then you've to restart the router and it continues nicely. I'll rate the main features separately below.        2.4 Ghz Channel - 6 out of 10, only reason is because it loses Internet all of a sudden, but it covers an amazing distance, I've a 1600SFT apartment and it covers corner to corner.        5G Channel - you can reach upto 100MB/s easily, distance covered is half or perhaps less than 2.5Ghz channel.        Looks - didn't matter much, but looks good.        Setup - Super easy,        Price - reasonable        Area coverage - for me , the 2.5Ghz covers more area than I needed, if you live in a bigger house then not sure"

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good throughput on 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz - Archer C6 AC1200 Gigabit MU-MIMO Mesh Router,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"I have been using N600 router of Netgear all these years and I have a 150 mbps internet connection from ACT.  Though it supports 300 mbps on both bands, I never used to get even a 10-12 mbps output.  After lots of research and study, I bought Archer C6 AC1200 Gigabit router and I was sweetly surprised to see that I could get consistently close to 80 to 90 mbps speed on 5 ghz band and 40 mbps on 2.4 band.  This is largely because it supports higher bandwidth and you can choose different IEEE protocols ranging from 802.11a/g/n/ac.  Both 11n and 11ac gives you higher bandwidths.  I got this for Rs. 2299 which is a very good price given the quality of the router.  If you have a higher bandwidth connection at home then this is one of the best routers available in this price range.  It is easy to install, good user interface, it also can be configured thru Tether mobile app which is pretty easy, very light weight with 5 antennas.  It also supports Onemesh technology where if you have multi floor house, and if you buy a compatible range extender from TP-Link (RE305 V3) it allows you to quickly create onemesh in the entire house by allowing to keep one SSID for 2.4 and 5 ghz bands.  The Onemesh technology identifies all wifi dead zones in your home and the range extender works like a magic to retelecast the signals from the main router across the home.  So as you move you can see the signals gets boosted up.  Worth buying and would recommend.        Pros:    - Dual bands 2.4 and 5 ghz gives you a total max bandwidth of 1.2 gbps if your ISP gives you that :-)    - Multiple protocols of 802.11 standards allow you to max your bandwidth    - Easy to configure and install with a decent user interface    - Can configure and control remotely (from outside your home) the router thru cloud and Tether mobile app    - Weighs light    - 5 antennas gives good coverage    - No need to restart the router when you change the channel number or mode    - 3 years warranty        Cons:    - Sometimes couldn't access the router thru the IP and have to use tplinkwifi.net    - V2 is only available in India.  But this is a US version of the product.  Though its not a con but you might not have latest features    - Product page in Amazon doesn't clearly specify the version number of the hardware, make (US or EU).  This is something seller needs to add as there are certain features of the functionality is not available always    - Online Help on the router page could have been little more detailed like in Netgear router where the explanation for each settings in the form of help is very good"

B07GVR9TG7,Goutam Barik,1.0 out of 5 stars,TP-Link Archer C6 router,Reviewed in India on 9 November 2020,"Delivery was very prompt.    About the product; it is only a router (dual band), and is NOT a modem. As far as features go, it has features that are available only on more expensive routers. To list a few: Gigabit LAN ports, ability to add a guest account, child lock etc.    Setting up is quite easy; either using the app from google playstore (this will only permit the quick setup option which will suffice for most users), or connect it to the modem, and connect a laptop/PC to the router. This is a web based option and you have access to the full setup menu. I used this option to setup. There was a firmware update which I carried out. (it does not alert you about firmware updates). The default wifi option is to set up the two bands 2.4G & 5G together. In theory this is supposed to permit the connected device to select the band offering better connectivity. This will only happen if your device has this facility. So, I set up the two bands separately with separate SSID & PW. Once set up, I configured the Amazon firestick, and the JIO STB to use the 5G band (gives better bandwidth for video streaming). My Moto phones had dual band capability; I left them on 2.4G. This band gives better range, especially through walls etc. Once set up, I found that the overall wifi performance had improved appreciably (I was earlier using an older TP-Link single band router).    To summarise; this is a budget router that has features found on more expensive models. Recommended product.    The last point is that it would be prudent to connect this to an UPS. Voltage spikes which are common can easily fry such equipment; UPS have good spike protection and voltage stabilisation circuits."
B07GVR9TG7,Vishal Karanth,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective product**Slow service turn around time**,Reviewed in India on 24 May 2021,"Mobile app is self explanatory and easy to configure the router. I have encountered a weird issue of bad signal and intermittent signal drop on 2.4 Ghz band just in a month after the purchase. It was a kind of disappointing to see a defective product. The service center was another disappointment. As per Tp-Link portal, they are working on all days Mon-Sat until 6PM except public holidays. But they were closed @ 5PM on a saturday which was not a public holiday @chennai service center.    Second visit they took my router for replacement and they it would take a month to get the replacement. That was the horrible part. I don't see that as a fair turnaround time for a customer who paid the product and now had to wait for a month without a router. That gives a feedback as poor customer care for TP-Link. I had used a Mi router in the past. I had intermittent disconnection issue, and they replaced it immediately. TP-Link has to seriously focus on the after sales part to gain customer confidence. Hope someone would read this to make betterment for the customers :-)"

Bought this to replace a Cisco Valet router that kept needing reboots.  Running stable so far. Speeds are vastly improved with this router. Am still to figure out why they have given beam-forming as an option , with default no. I would have thought it would be turned on by default and have no idea why it should ever be turned off.    I would not suggest a tplink account to get remote access etc - you are only creating another security hole.        Been running stably for over a week. Quite happy with this product!"

B07GVR9TG7,Raju,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good signal. but not ""smart""",Reviewed in India on 18 January 2021,"The review is about the AC1200 C6 router. The signal strength of this router is good.    But I have problems with the ""smart connect"" capability which is very poor. I found that when the smart mode is activated, the signal strength is poor. When this mode is turned off, I can see the two networks separately (2.4 and 5 Ghz) and logging in separately gives higher signal strength. For example in the smart mode my PC always logs into the 2.4gHz band giving poor signal strength (30 Mbps). When smart mode is off, and I manually login to the 5gHZ band, it gives  nearly 90 Mbps.  I could have brought an ordinary dual band router without smart connect and got same result."
B07GVR9TG7,JoshAraujo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like any other router but doesn't overheat/fluctuate as much in signal quality,Reviewed in India on 2 December 2020,"Overpriced and overrated as a router - it is okay - does the job, and offers you speed upto 50mbps - maybe 60 even - chops off higher bandwidth - does not have great range. If you have a house with a central room which is close to all other rooms (more or less) it works fine - if you have a bit more than 40ft+ long laid out house with rooms in a line behind each other, then expct to use signal amplifiers or extra routers.    The dlink routers do a much better job. If you are investing in a router for 2-3 years, i suggest that you upgrade and buy a higher range/higher bandwidth one. If you are looking for something to work in the 50mbps range with range less than 30 ft, then cheaper routers from netgear/even tplink do the job just as well.    It is however reliable and does not drop signal frequently even after 2 years of continuous use. It doesn't get overheated like cheaper routers."

This is probably the worst router I have come across. Biggest issue with this router is firmware stability. You go to any forum and search for this router, everyone is facing firmware issues. There's absolutely no support from TP Link for this router. Firmware is just pathetic. Router keeps rebooting. Random disconnections. Connection dropping. Worst latency, jerky web browsing are just some of the problems with this router. This problems are due to bad firmware support. I went with this router based on my old TP link N150 router which is rock solid even after 10 years of usage but this purchase was a mistake. Please avoid this router. Its not worth it.

Installation is easy and happened within a minute.    2. Router looks are good.    3. The antennas are huge.    4. The processing power is great.    5. With 3 bands you can distribute your load easily and also give priority accordingly.        Cons:    1. No LED's on the side showing status. If you have kept the router at a height of 5 feet you wont be able to see any indications etc.    2. In spite of the huge antennas (6) the range is very low. It does not even cover my 1100 sq. ft flat.    The range is same as my 10 year old router.    Cannot penetrate multiple walls (not even 2).    3. Did not find any settings to boost the signal.    4. Too costly.        Overall not happy after spending 20K. Expected much better performance than I am getting.

Moreover since this the new version V3. 2 it has firmware issues wifi signal drops and comes back intermittently which is very annoying hope this issue is resolved soon by tp link. If you are considering to buy this router on reviews please reconsider this product is wrongly overrated.    Currently i am regretting my decision to go with tp link    Edit- After july2021  firmware update C6 is performing good giving stable wifi .But If ur considering buying router in this price range go for Linksys E5600 which regularly goes on sale for 2700 rs    It also has EASY MESH support which can create a mesh network with another linksys E5600 or other Easy mesh compatible router from another company. Tp link does not offer this great feature ,it is just trying to sell mesh extenders .    These days of fiber connections speed ranging from 100 -300 mbs ,mesh network of routers is a absolute necessity to get full speed in every corner of house."
B07GVR9TG7,Arun Sharma,1.0 out of 5 stars,For 2500 Rs you deserve better than this router.,Reviewed in India on 12 December 2020,"Appario might send you a used item. Be warned!        Model: Archer C6 V2 (EU)        This router supports only  the band 1 on 5GHz frequency.        Everytime the router reboots it will reset the bandwith of 5GHz frequency to 80MHz. So everytime the router boots up you have to switch to 40MHz manually. I was told by the TP-Link India customer support to set the bandwidth to auto instead of 80MHz. On Auto mode the bandwith on router was always set to 80MHz which I don't want.        Firmware is simply laggy, takes 3 seconds to load a menu on the Router management Page.        Router emits 2 hidden WiFi that you have no control over ( this hidden wifi is used for OneMesh). Even if you disable the Wireless radio for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio the hidden network will still be enabled. A TP-Link representative said that this is by design. However, I'm pretty sure that TP-Link added an option to disable it on it's other higher-end  Router.        All the problems that I have mentioned here were posted on TP-Link's community forum so check it out to see if these problems were fixed.        Many have complained of unstable 2.4Hz WiFi radio being unstable and that their device were disconnected from the WiFi. I didn't face this issue because I don't use 2.4GHz."
B07GVR9TG7,Tush,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for video calls 👎😤,Reviewed in India on 16 May 2021,"TP-Link Archer C6 is a good looking router, but not serving its main purpose. The wall penetration is adequate but not as good as 👉""Tenda A10"". Mine is a 100Mbps connection and following are the speed results;    ---------------------------------------------------------------    5Ghz  - Same room, 104Mbps up & dwn. After a wall, (4-5m) no range!    (to get the max 5Ghz speeds, disable the 'auto band switching' to manual in the router settings)    2.5Ghz- Same room, 30-45Mbps up & dwn. After a wall or two, 15-25Mbps up &dwn.    ---------------------------------------------------------------    The rage of 2.4Ghz is good after 3 walls but the speeds are terrible.  After many reviews and articles, I found that among Tenda A10, Archer C6 and Archer C60, the TP-Link Archer C60 is the best performer. But the problem with TP-Link Archer C60 that, it has no gigabit port.        👉 If the connection speed is 100Mbps or more, gigabit ports are needed. Even in a 100Mbps connection, the speeds are limited to around 90Mbps without the gigabit port. 👈        I got two of these C6 modem and both are terrible with video calls. Constant disconnection!! Returned both of them and got Tenda AC10. Now everything works perfectly. Tenda AC10 also have the 2.4Ghz slow speed issue. Now I am planning to return it too and go for TP-Link Archer C80 AC1900. 😆😆"

B07GVR9TG7,Midhun,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good speed,Reviewed in India on 30 December 2020,"I've been reviewing lot of dual band routers in recent , was waiting for a long time . At last decided to go with this TP Link .  Wi-fi signals are awesome . I have a 100 mbps net pack and now getting almost 80 mbps speed through 5G band on my phone and laptop .  Its the first day so i would test it for couple of days and provide my review again . So far i am happy with the delivery , installation & Wifi signals.  No cons i could figure out , just that router is little bigger in size. ( Not too big though ) . Also Antennas are unremovable , so you can't upgrade it to high antennas if you have any plans.  I would recommend go for it .  Budget friendly router"

The package was open and taped up. The technician who came to install the product started laughing seeing the router. He said we could have bought the product from another online seller for almost half the price. After installation, the signal is excellent provided I take my computer 500 micrometers (half a millimeter) closer to the modem. I have to build a nest on the wall to sue this product.

B07GVR9TG7,Muralikrishna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Poor 2.4Ghz performance and range,Reviewed in India on 8 August 2019,Archer C6 takes 2-3 minutes to boot up in comparison to 20-30 seconds of my 7 year old 150Mbps single antenna Dlink DIR-600L router. Idk why this Qualcomm chipset is that slower than that old router.    I've a fiber 60 Mbps plan. I place router next to window not a bricked wall so that signal spreads better.    On 5Ghz Archer C6 gives great 58/59 Mbps speed but for 12 feet circle. While on 2.4Ghz I was getting poor 30Mbps download and pathetic 12Mbps uploading sitting next to router and 6-8 Mbps on the next to next room of same floor (24 feet). I tested a lot of times. In comparison my old Dlink router gives both 30-45 Mbps upload and download speed for 10-12 feet circle and 6-8 on 24 feet distance.    I've tried to reset Archer C6 thrice and changed different settings but poor 2.4Ghz performance remain the same. Also the range is pretty average on 2.4Ghz. I couldn't even connect on the floor above with both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz frequency.        Overall these 4 external long antennas are like tusks of elephant. Just for show not of much use. Buy this only for great 5Ghz performance of your fiber plans. But alas! these 5Ghz routers range is quite lower than 2.4Ghz. I suggest 5Ghz extenders for more range.
B07GVR9TG7,Somnombulist007,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is Blazing Faaast !!!,Reviewed in India on 25 April 2021,"Please note this review is unbiased & based on my experience.        This is just insane (i have subscribed 50Mbps FTTH Connection from a local ISP),    Their service is pretty good but the problem was i would never achieve 100% speeds as promised after complaining them they forced me to upgrade my Router from D-link 600M to this TP-Link Archer C1200 & Ohh my God this is just insanely fast. When i do a speedtest i get 50Mbps download & this is slightly fluctuating for around 2-3%. The 5g bandwidth provides blazing speeds but less range & 2.5g bandwidth provides decent Range but less speeds. this gigabit router doesn't mind if you're wirelessly connected or over LAN the speeds are always damn good.        The Router Setup was fairly good (for non-technically ones, it'll be damn good experience) through the Application.    also the features are pretty impressive.        Thank you Amazon for delivering it in 48hrs as promised."

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not Happy with its performance,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"I was using D-Link 300mbps and had no issue.  Act fiber people changed the service wire from 2pair to 4 pair and was adviced to change the route to make use of the 4pair bandwidth, speed etc.    I find the Speed to be slow.  The earlier one from D-Links was faster even though it was only 300mbps.  I connected my TV / Prime / Hotstar to 5G and the remaining devices ( mobiles, iPad and PC ) to the other.  Still speed is slow."
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the upgrade!,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"I've had D-Link routers since 5-6 years they were reliable with my ACT fibernet as I did not have heavy usage on Wi-Fi and was using lan cable for work I was planning and holding on to upgrade to a Mesh router. Since last month I started facing issues with wifi coverage and had unstable connection so after some research I postponed my plans to buy a Mesh router (I didn't find any in my budget) and went with this router.        The installation was seamless there's an app for it. The coverage is great, it switches it's bands depending on the distance of your device. Even with my two old D-Link routers I never had this much coverage. The speeds on wifi reach 140+ Mbps easily. I was able to bridge my old D-Link router as a repeater just to get the coverage to every nook and corner. It has 4 lan ports with gigabit support, This even has Mesh tech so you can buy more such routers and add them to the same Mesh (don't know how that works) but always good to have that option. Definitely go for it."
B07GVR9TG7,amber,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good router. Needs stable firmware.,Reviewed in India on 23 July 2020,This router comes packed with features and is one of the very popular ones in the market. However it's very sensitive to power fluctuations. If you live in a place where load shedding still happens beware as every time the router is powered off improperly it needs to be reset to factory settings. I think this can be resolved in future firmware updates. Good thing the set up is easy and quick. It did fail to be connected on to my LG webos TV after the first setup however after resetting the router it was connected to the TV. The automatic switching between 2.5g and 5g works very well too.
B07GVR9TG7,Vegeta,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not good one,Reviewed in India on 13 May 2021,I'm currently using a single band Mi Router since last 4 year with my 60Mbps Internet connection which gives full speed of 60Mbps without any issue. Since I'm planning to upgrade my internet to a fiber connection I Purchased 'TP-Link Archer C6'. With my surprise the speed of internet gone down to 35Mbps and frequent drop in service. So returned the product. Didn't meet my expectation.

Terrace, is also good coverage.  On the ground floor sufficient signal in the room just below the router.  As I move to other rooms signal drops and coverage will drop to 0.  It solved my problem getting signal on the ground floor to the needed place.  If we use some more signal strengthening simple practices it might boost further. For now my needs are met"
B07GVR9TG7,Soumyajit Basu,2.0 out of 5 stars,Adequate router with decent performance,Reviewed in India on 11 August 2020,"Ordered the first time, sold by Appario, and received a V2.0 (EU) Archer C6. Spoke to customer care, got a replacement ordered. It arrived the next day, a V3.2 (US) Archer C6, again sold by Appario. I don't know if it was dumb luck or if customer care was able to put in a note or something for the fulfillment center but I can confirm that you can get a V3.2 (US) Archer C6 if in case any of you received an older version. V3.2 (US) is 30% smaller than V2.0, has the same 4 external and 1 internal antennas and has One Mesh features advertised on the box. You can see the visual differences between the 2 versions on TP-Link's website.        As far as the performance and features are concerned, at this price, this is probably the best option for most people who want a set it and forget it WiFi router. There's no USB port and not a lot in the way of advanced bandwidth management or steering. It does have MU-MIMO and you have the option of simplifying your home WiFi into broadcasting just 1 SSiD (the router decides between the 2.4 GHz and 5GHz band) or choosing to broadcast two distinct SSiDs.        A word to the wise: try placing the router in a location where the router can have line of sight to most places you use WiFi from. It's not easy but well worth the effort."
B07GVR9TG7,Asief Mohammed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A good product with many features, but not matching description.",Reviewed in India on 3 November 2020,"After 40 days of experience, I am writing this....    This router is genuinely a good product with so many features and also the TP-Link tech support is really nice. But the WiFi coverage area of its 2.4 GHz is not as per the description. If you're keeping this router on 1st floor of a 3 storey house (Each floor's dimensions: 30 ft. x 40 ft.), you may not get the signal from the far extreme corner of ground floor or 2nd floor whereas a Single Band Router is reachable. Anyway rest all the things are fine, and the I issue mentioned isn't affecting me a lot, because hardly I require WiFi in that much extent.

B07GVR9TG7,Swetha,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best Budget Gigabit Dual-Band Router,Reviewed in India on 31 January 2021,"*TLDR;* Best budget gigabit dual-band router that's also quite easy to install and use. The Tether app works surprisingly well and you really just need the app to set everything up. The downside is that it takes FOREVER to boot and runs a little too hot for my liking.        *NOTE: DO NOT GET THE ARCHER C60*. If you have >100 Mbps plans, this is what you need. Otherwise, make sure the *WAN port supports gigabit speeds*. Don't think that 1200 Mbps means it will work with your JioFi/FTTH connections.        *Why did I get this?:*    Wanted something cheap for my WFH setup at home and had bought the same one for my flat. It seemed to handle me and my mates' work+streaming+gaming pretty well so decided to buy the same and not overthink too much. I must say that for this price, considering the alternatives, this one is pretty good. I have a 200Mbps FTTH connection and the router is able to deliver to about 6-8 devices connected to it on average.        *The irritating bits:*    I know that at this price, you really don't see anything better but this definitely has its limits. For starters, it takes extremely long to boot-up. This doesn't happen all that often since router is on 24*7 but when it does, I really wanna throw it out. Second, it runs pretty hot. Not a huge deal since it so far hasn't caused a serious performance degradation for me. It's also quite slow to re-connect sometimes on failing to authenticate via PPPoE (seemed to work fine when you're getting a direct ethernet connection instead of the cable TV provider workaround I have). I also wish the signal strength was a bit better but for the price, well, you gotta adjust. If you have an existing, supported TP-Link device, you can mesh them together so that's nice."
B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Solved multi device connectivity problem,Reviewed in India on 3 September 2020,"When our internet service provider changed our network cable from cat5 to cat6 our old router (about 4 year old) started misbehaving. It is allocating entire bandwidth to a single device. We could download gigabytes of data in a few minutes, but during this time all other devices connected to router were chocking for bandwidth.        TP-LINK Archer solved the problem.        - The speed is uniform across multiple devices. At any given point in time 3-4 audio / video calls are going on across multiple devices, no issues so far.    - The signal strength is pretty decent across a duplex house. All these devices are at a distance of about 40 feet across two floors.    - Did not turn off the device in about a month of usage. It is a little warm, no heating issues so far.        Amazon did a great job in delivering the device in less than 12 hours. We ordered around 9:00 pm and the device is in our house around 7:00 am next day!"

My main reason for buying this product is enhance/wide coverage with good speeds, but couldn't get that. May be my expectation is bit high and I might have to look for an alternative (wifi extender) solution."

They promised call but never called me. 3 executives disconnected the call after listening to the problem. Even after 8 calls no proper answer as they dont know about their product.

B07GVR9TG7,Samarth Shamarao,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good router, easy to use, provides strong signal",Reviewed in India on 7 November 2020,"This is a perfect device for my requirements. My 1800 sqft house had several dead zones and since I take office calls even while in the washroom which is located at one corner, having a device that sends a good signal all around the house was necessary.        I use a 75 Mbps connection and due to the 5Ghz bandwidth that this router offers, I get not less than 65-70 Mbps on my laptop or mobile phone. The user interface of the router is extremely easy to use and anyone without any technical knowledge will be able to set up the router. Its 4 antennas throw signal all around and even vertically. My router is placed in the attic of the ground floor and I'm able to take WhatsApp calls at the terrace, i.e. 2nd floor, around 12 meters distant from the router. One drawback, however, is that the signal gets weak at the diagonally opposite corners of the terrace(and first floor) but that's expected I think.        Overall I'm quite satisfied with the device because I was using TP-Link 300 Mbps router for years and it was proving to be inefficient.        I use a local fibre internet, not Jio/Airtel and since both the ISPs provide their own router, I can't advise if this router will work with Jio or Airtel fibre connections."

And the installation process is quite simple and one can easily fix it using the manuals provided in the box.        I am currently using act fiber 150 Mbps internet plan..with the use of 5 g.h the speed is reaching above 100 - 130 Mbps and covering short distances (ground floor and can use it for short distance with high speed)    -Using 2.5 g.h the distance coverage is more but the speed is quite less when it compares to 5 ghrz.(first floor it's giving around 30-50 Mbps speed).        -Connectivity is really good and can connect multiple devices at a time..        Over the performance of this product is reallly good !! If someoneone is looking for home purpose this is one you can choose from !!

This is one of the poorest customer support I have been in contact. Raise RMA in early October and it's been a month with no support.        What's surprising is TP-Link do not have an escalation matrix and the ticket has been updated with all misleading information about them reaching out to me, which has never happened.        Though the warranty is for 3 years. Without much support or response no point having even 100 years of warranty."

Using it with 50 mbps internet plan and literally getting 50 mbps download/upload speed with both 5 and 2.4 GHz bands.        Called tplink tech support and they helped me to configure some settings, which fixed the only issue I was facing, WiFi signals were getting lost like 4-5 times a day.

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,4 Antenna and many bugs,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"My experience with this router is very poor. Firstly the signal strength of the router is not as great as it is made out to be in most of the reviews. I bought this router to replace my perfectly working Netgear WNDR 3700 series router which did not have MIMO and beam forming but otherwise had b/g/n and only had an internal antenna with USB support.        The signal from this router does not go much further than my older router despite having 4 antenna and beam forming.        Many of my IoT devices and a couple of Raspberry Pi which worked flawlessly with my Netgear 3700 router simply cannot connect to this router for no apparent reason and they work in the 2.4Ghz band so it should have been perfectly compatible.        My Dell Laptop which used to connect flawlessly with the WNDR every time now mostly does not connect automatically and I have to manually connect it.        This router has a buggy firmware for sure even though it has the latest firmware and is c6 v 3.2        When connecting to any internal device using SSH, the keystrokes take time to appear! I had never experienced this with the Netgear.        Note that this router is NOT compatible with dd-wrt open source firmware, so you are stuck with the TPLink software and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.        Overall I think this router is really poor if you are a professional who has many devices and many protocols. It may work fine for average users, which explains the misleading number of positive reviews.        I've finally decided to disconnect it and use my original Net Gear WNDR 3700 again. This device is hopeless.        Update on 24/6/2021    Despite calling their ""Customer Support"" 8 times in the last 4 days, there is no response. The customer service phone number is a call center where they understand NOTHING. You basically tell them and repeat about 5 times. Then they promise an engineer will call you within 24 hours and now after 72 hours and 8 calls there is still no call. Their explanation is that they call from Avaya and not by normal phone so something is wrong.        ABSOLUTE FRUSTRATION."
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value for money, highly recommended.",Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"This was an upgrade from the Linksys E900 router. The dual band 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz certainly makes a big difference as compared to the single band E900.        For reference, I'm currently on the 75 Mbps plan from ACT.        With the E900, my maximum download speed was topping off at 60 Mbps. However, with the upgrade in place, I'm now getting a consistent 70+ Mbps at all times (the speeds with the E900 used to fluctuate a lot).        Range too, is pretty good on this router. Do bear in mind, however, that the range will take a substantial hit when connected to the 5 GHz  WiFi as compared to the 2.4 GHz.        For those of you who're new to dual band WiFi routers like me, note that this will broadcast two separate SSIDs, one for each band, depending on which your speed and range will vary.        The setup process was an absolute breeze. Simply plug in the power and the internet cable and connect to either of the SSIDs using the password printed on the underside of the router on a computer or smartphone (computer is recommended) and open up your browser. The configuration page should open automatically. Follow the steps and you're good to go in no time. You could also download the Tether app available for Android and iOS devices for changing settings and monitoring the list of connected devices on the fly.        Go for it, it's well worth your money."

B07GVR9TG7,Nakul Rattan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jio Fiber Users Must Read This,Reviewed in India on 21 April 2018,Writing this to help Jio Fiber Customers. I have an apartment of approx 2400 Sqft. I have a Jio Home Gateway installed in my drawing room and i was using it to do my office work from the bedroom. (Approx 30ft apart) . Neither 5Ghz band worked nor 2.5 Ghz        The wifi signal from Jio there was pathetic.I purchased a range extender from TP Link RE 300 to extend the wifi signal. It didn’t help. I had to use 4G every day to connect to my office. The signal from extender was full but Jio Home Gateway and Range Extender were not working properly together. Connection between Range Extender and Jio Home Gateway kept dropping and i was suffering a lot.        I ordered this router and I’m very happy and satisfied with the purchase. I turned off Wifi signal from Jio Home Gateway and connected this router by Lan Cable to Jio Gateway        Now this router and my range extender do wonders! No more conference call drops and internet disconnections!        I recommend this router for people like me. This made me realise how terrible Jio Home Gateway is in terms of Wifi coverage (both 2.4 and 5ghz bands)
B07GVR9TG7,Peet,1.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty 2.4 ghz chip or firmware,Reviewed in India on 5 January 2019,"It seems to have a faulty 2.4 ghz chip mostly and not the firmware side. Because people have been facing this problem with all their typse of router as per a post on their forum. I am experience frequent disconnect on the device which tries to connect on 2.4 ghz and it works when device reboot. I have few IoT devices which does not support 5 ghz. Sad that the day i am writing the review a day before return period is over exchange is not possible now. To soon to get such hardware failure.        Update:    I just removed the stock firmware and installed OpenWrt and open source networking framework for routers. And problem is solved. So, i was correct it was only the firmware issue not the hardware. which a brand like tp-link not able to solve, sad. I would still suggest stay away from it. I wonder if i every will be able to buy tp-link router again."
B07GVR9TG7,Xyz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got a Defective Product,Reviewed in India on 31 October 2020,"I've been using TP-Link Routers at home and work for quite some time now, however since I upgraded my net speed to 100mbps I had to get one these so-called Giga Routers. Like in the past I assumed this would also be a Set-up and forget about it like all the others before it.    Once the set up was done I could log-on to the net for exactly 2 mins before the Router would REBOOT! Thought it might have been a 1-time anomaly or might have been something wrong with the connection.    Got the connection check, replaced it one of my old TP-Link Routers and it was working fine.    I wasn't getting the Full Range and Bandwith I was getting with the Giga router but at least it was rebooting involuntarily every few minutes.    After checking everything else I concluded that there was an issue with the router I received.    I checked Online and turns out some of the other users of this same C1200 model were facing the same issues as well. None of them could find a solution.        I have returned this Router ... It might have been one of those 1 in 100 defective piece or there might some an issue with this model an not sure which. However, I would recommend anyone buying this model to check for this issue on the day they receive the package.        Please Note I have reordered another model of TP-Link Router and am hoping that doesn't have the same issue."
B07GVR9TG7,Rizwan Ansari,1.0 out of 5 stars,Most Appropriate and Worth Buying,Reviewed in India on 22 June 2020,"Have purchased this router recently. I have a 175 Mbps connection at home and did some tests.        Within a radius of 7 meters it was giving following download speeds on 5 Ghz upto 160 Mbps, 2.4 Ghz upto 95 Mbps        I tried also for a 12 meter radius and got the following speeds on 5 Ghz upto 120 Mbps and on 2.4 Ghz upto 85 Mbps.        Have also tried for a 20 meter radius and found that the 2.4 Ghz was giving a speed upto 15 Mbps. So in all the wi-fi signal range is also reasonable.        The upload speeds I am getting is between 90-95 Mbps on 5 GHz and 70-80 Mbps on 2.4 Ghz        It takes around 1.5 mins to boot when switched on. Has a really Premium look.        I received the version 3.2 which is the latest one and as exactly shown currently on the amazon site and also on the tp link official site.        The router was delivered the very next day as promised and the packaging was also very good.        So far so good. Enjoying working with this router which is really helping with very less loss of signal and reasonable range and would definitely recommend to others."
B07GVR9TG7,Varun Gathani,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Few ups and few downs, but worth for the amount I spent (Archer C7)",Reviewed in India on 23 February 2020,"(Archer C7)    Works as expected. First the processor was always at 100%, but later it's normal. Router bottom is always warm.        I've bought this router for better Wi-Fi coverage, a good NAS, to be able to flash custom firmware like DD-WRT.        Well, Wi-Fi coverage is always sub-par compared with other routers, so don't expect great Wi-Fi coverage like Netgear/asus. But it's decent. It has mesh feature with compatible extenders, but I'm living in a medium sized home and WiFi covers almost all places. It has an option to merge both 2.4 and 5GHz networks with single SSID, so that router will manage which type of network you need based on distance from router. NAS have both FTP and Samba protocols, but both don't work so easily. I Always face issues with Samba. File transfer speeds in 5GHz signal is Max 2 to 3 MBps, some times constant 500 to 600 kbps, don't know why the big variation. FTP always works, but can't transfer multiple files at once as it's protocol limitation. Planned to flash DD-WRT, but so far the router working good, using more than 20 devices, no networking issues, showing real time performance and logs are accurate and don't want to give up Alexa integration with router. So, I've postponed the custom firmware flashing.        Final verdict: it's worth for the amount I paid (₹4,500)."
B07GVR9TG7,Sanjoy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prepare for a volley of firmware problems, specification dissapointments and zero technical support.",Reviewed in India on 17 May 2021,"Does its job OK. Good hardware for the price.        But currently there are massive firmware problems for this device that lead to WiFi problems, especially on the 2.4 GHz network that make it unusable in many cases. Check the TP-Link forums before buying. So unless you want to get your hands dirty and test every bit of functionality and become TP-Link's QA department, go for something that's plug and play. Technical support will not help you with anything beyond a standard set of solutions. Their phone support has abysmal wait times.        5 GHz radio only supports bands 36,40,44 and 48. So if you have multiple TP-Link Archer C6s with some configured as APs in your network, 5 GHz can operate only at a 20 MHz channel width. This is not mentioned anywhere on their product page. Also, the WebUI says 5 GHz is broadcasting at 20 MHz, but its actually putting out an 80 MHz signal, which in my case means unusability due to interference between 3 APs. Email support hasn't got back to me in a week, and they are ignoring my emails.        Also, no ethernet backhaul for these devices. OneMesh is wireless backhaul and works only with a TP-Link router as master and a TP-Link range extender as slave. So if you plan on using multiple router units to enhance coverage at your home/office (some in AP mode), WiFi roaming is managed on the client device. There will be no intelligent hand-off between different APs.        TL;DR : Too many firmware issues. Non-existent technical support, even if you provide them with detailed testing data. Specifications not as advertised. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!"

Now in this router, the internet port and ethernet port stopped working in 10 days.

The app is a convenient way of setting the router up, I set it up with a static IP and all went fine.    Then came the step where I could rename the router and change its default password. No matter how many times I tried this, once the router restarts (after confirming the settings) my phone (iPhone) won't connect to the router! So I ended up with the default router name and password!    Other than that, the router gets quite warm during operation. And the 5G signal has a very limited reach."
B07GVR9TG7,Anonymous customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Overall OK...if your requirements are not advanced!,Reviewed in India on 3 June 2019,"It's good if we see it as basic/semi advanced router. Overall 6-7 pts out of 10. Looking at the cost, it's very good.    5 GHz coverage is very short, should have been better. 2.4 Ghz is decent. Wifi schedule is cool feature. Gig ports do justice. 4 external antenas (should have been replaceable). Sleek design.    Booting takes long time. Got V3.2. Sleek but I will ask TPLink for better design in terms of status lights size, position and visibility. If we plan to wall mount this model then almost no chance to get view of status lights. Coming to features, though list of options shows multiple advanced areas, they are much controlled by the firmware for effective configuration/utilization. like QoS....    Even a very basic router is having individual device bandwidth control option but this doesn't have. Not sure what challenge TPLink is having in providing such things in one go. I hope the hardware is capable and in coming updates TPLink provides full feature set utilization options considering the customer requests."

I am using a 100mbps connection and the old router couldn't give a good speed more than 30 mbps and thier use to be lag and jitter. So I research for a good budget friendly dual ban router and ended up narrowing down to Archer C6 ac 1200 and archer ac1350. Ended up getting C6 as its a newer model with better components. After I installed c6 I am getting 80 to 100mbps with 5g network and even the 2g ban is giving much higher range and speed than the old one. Their is a huge improvement in range even with the 5g. No lag or whatever while gaming unlike with the old router. Set up was very easy. Performance and range is really good for the price. Overall I would definitely recommend this router if you are looking for a budget oriented dual band router."

Pros - High sped gig router.      Dual band Ac      Control Remotely      USB Interface      4 Lan ports    Cons - Big in size      Short range router      This is V2.    V3 already in market but still we are getting V2.
B07GVR9TG7,Deep K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,,Reviewed in India on 23 June 2020,"PROS: Coverage is great at 2.4Ghz. The signal can be received from a 3storeyed building as I live in one. Outside my house the coverage was also great, I received the signal at a distance of around 45meters away from the point of installation. Haven't checked the 5GHz signal as I don't have the supported hardware in any of the mobile devices or laptops.        CONS: Till date haven't found much except few times had to switch off the router as the mobile devices won't connect to the router even though there was internet connection."
B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Router with some limitations to understand,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"The wifi router should be placed at a place where it is reachable to complete house.    It is observed that, the signals from this wifi router are not crossing the wall boundaries effectively.    The wireless speed of the router is also depend upon how effectively the incoming fiber optic gives the speed from broadband provider.    Overall, the wifi router is good for 4 points out of 5."
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst router ever.,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,This is by far the worst router I have ever purchased. I have no clue why it is so highly rated on Amazon. I bought a far cheaper Tenda router on AliExpress and that worked much better than this router. I do not know why this router even exists. Half the time there's signal problem. Other half there's problem connecting to it.
B07GVR9TG7,Sanjay K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Seriously recommended product,Reviewed in India on 3 December 2021,Absolutely wondering about this product. Super signal and the strength is very high. Very easy to install via computer as well as from TP Link Tether from mobile.    Anyone can buy this product without any hesitation and also the build quality is super and from looks perspective its unique and gorgeous as well.
B07GVR9TG7,Viranch Damani,1.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money,Reviewed in India on 8 May 2021,"This AC1200 router from TP Link gives you all the features that other ""branded"" companies give you for half the price. This router is a perfect device for a medium size home and the coverage is quite good. The setup is very quick and easy. The UI of the router is also very well laid out and easy to use and I prefer this UI to the ones from Linksys and Netgear. Overall a very good router and in this price range I think it is the best you can get."
B07GVR9TG7,Ashis Pyne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good budget router for high speed internet.,Reviewed in India on 2 September 2021,"I bought this router when I upgraded my internet plan to excess of 100 mbps which is bare minimum speed provided by isps now a days, so I needed a new router to support those high speed, this one fits the bill perfectly. Its got 1gbps ethernet lan ports which will cover most internet plans. It also has a cool one mesh support that turns your old router into range extender provided your old router is compatible and is of the same brand like I had. Setting up the router is super easy and it comes with mobile app for easy configuration. I would definitely recommend this router for upto 1gbps internet connection. Wifi strength was a upgrade from my old router and it supports 5ghz bandwidth so its compatible with most smartphones."
B07GVR9TG7,Bilal Parkar,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best (available) out there!!,Reviewed in India on 28 June 2019,"Its a great product. Install it in the right place, and you wont need an extender for your 3 BHK. Easy to set-up and the 2.4G/5G dual mode manages your range and connectivity easily. The mobile app (you have to download) is handy too.        I am giving it 5 starts as I prefer another model from TP link (Archer C1200) - this one has pen-drive support. Unfortunately it is not easily available these days"

B07GVR9TG7,Naveen Lamghare,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic,Reviewed in India on 16 December 2020,"Writing a review after 4 months of usage.        The wifi is easy to setup and use. There are two channels 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz.        I'm using a 100Mbps internet at home and I get the full speed (literally 100Mbps) on 5Ghz channel.    However the maximum speed that I'd get on 2.4Ghz is hardly 40Mbps.        The smart switch (that automatically switches between these two channels) is also not giving speeds more than 70Mbps.        I called the customer care to address the issue on the speed and the interaction was full of surprises.        First thing, the technical representative is not so technical. I had to explain him the difference between MB and Mb.        Second, he said that it's expected to have a data loss of up to 50% on this router. I don't even know why one should go for such a pathetic router (after I informed him saying that no solution he provided had worked).        Third, he's not completely aware of the router specifications. I was surprised to hear that their company doesn't claim the support of 867Mbps on 5Ghz channel (which when later verified was proved to be false. I could download the spec from their website which clearly mentions it)        Fourth, being not so satisfied with the interaction, I wrote am email to the tech support team to look into the matter, but it's been more than 3 weeks with 2 reminders, but no one has responded so far.        So, after sale service is pathetic. Please don't go for this. We have better ones in the market"
B07GVR9TG7,Gabriel Charles,4.0 out of 5 stars,WiFi strength low otherwise very good,Reviewed in India on 3 July 2021,It's one of the best Wi-Fi routers out there . I have been using it for a month now. It's quite easy to install but you will need your ISP's help in order to configure the router.    Interface is pretty basic and easy anyone with basic knowledge can also setup the router. I am unhappy with the Wi-Fi signal. Even though i have installed the router in the center of my house it is unable to cover the complete house . I will have to use a WiFi range extender which would cost me extra 2k. I didn't have this issue with my earlier router from Tenda (2 antenna). But this is a really good product and provides really good speeds. It supports upto 1200 MBps
B07GVR9TG7,Ravi Teja Kothapalli,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good product. Works well.,Reviewed in India on 11 July 2020,"A good router. I bought it after quite a research.  Suits well for a 3BHK. One thing I like to write here is that my win 10 laptop was dropping signals for quite some time so I just changed the laptop power policy of the Wi-Fi by going into wifi settings and unchecking an option which said "" allow windows to switch off this device for power saving."" Then the signal drops were gone."

B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"So i am writing this review after using it for 20 days    Pro's    1) this data transfer speed is awesome in both mode wired and wireless    2) the connection is very good in open area can cover upto 15 meter in open area    3) UI is good and easy to use with remote management system    4) transfer speed upto gigabit in wired connection    Con's    1) it cannot penetrate more than 2-3 walls in the straight path.    2) the wireless connection goes very poor if there is pillar, column, or concrete slab comes in between the connection.

B07GVR9TG7,Neeraj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beware : This does NOT work as a WIRELESS repeater!,Reviewed in India on 22 October 2020,"The product gives you the impression that you can use this as a wireless extender/repeater. This is NOT the case. You need to connect an ethernet cable from your main router to this router to make it a extender/repeater.        While the product works fine, the reason i am giving 2 stars is for this misleading representation"
B07GVR9TG7,Vamshi V.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Speed capped at 300Mbps only,Reviewed in India on 18 August 2020,"Reviewing after 8 9 months of use.    I have a gigabit ethernet connection, but still it only supports 300 Mbps only on 5G WiFi band(Not mentioned on the box) and on 2.4ghz it only gives out 50 Mbps max. Don't go for it thinking it will serve you good.    1. Reboot takes more than 3 4 mins.    2. Need to schedule a reboot schedule as on Pppoe connection it gives out errors in every 2 3 days.    3. Even when ipv4 connection is established, it will not allow the internet to pass through neither on WiFi nor on Lan.( You need multiple restarts)    4. Range is Just adequate for a 2 floored house. But still I had to get another cheap router for my other floor.    5. Gigabit Ethernet works fine.    6. It has issues on 2.4ghz with ping. Ex- if I am getting 2 ms ping on Lan, on 2.4 GHz band it would be around 15 ms.        Verdict    Value for money 6/10    Performance 4/10        If you can afford to buy a router from ASUS or NETGEAR ,then only buy them I still have  6 7 year old Asus and Netgear which just work flawlessly."

TP-Link have done such a fantastic job with the setup process of this device!

I hoped that the 5GH would travel atleast two floors but it works only when sitting very close proximity to it.        I would have not ordered this one  had I known that the 5GHz is not strong over a distance. Would have stick to my 2.5GHz N Router.

It was my local ISP mistake as previous router MAC address was bounded in their system which wasn't letting me to configure this device. They made me realize that product is faulty, however TP link customer service also told me that product is faulty where in the problem was with the MAC address. I resolved this issue on my own spending hours on Internet, then got to solution of MAC cloning. I deducted 1* as product has heating issues and takes time to reboot but as far as coverage and features like MIMO, Gigabit is concern is superb. I also tried Alexa skills but they are limited. Post activation, I used it for hours without any issue except heating issue which seems OK as it has GHZ processor."

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent speeds in this gigabit router,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,This router C1200 works like a charm on my 200 MBPS connection provided by ACT. It gives a speed of about 95 Mbps near the router in 5ghz band and about 40 MBPS in the 2.4 GHz band.The speeds in the nearby rooms are also quite good.The range of the 5ghz band is especially good.Previously I had single band router and it gave speed of about 30 MBPS only that too near the router.A few months ago I purchased Archer C20 model router but the speeds were disappointing that I had to return it and go back to my old router. Then my internet service provider ask me to go for this model so that I could take advantage of my 200 MBPS connection. It is a great choice especially for those whose connection speeds are 100 MBPS and more.In far away rooms one should use a wifi extender like the tplink RE200 along with this to extend the range.

B07GVR9TG7,Muthu Kumarasamy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Router,Reviewed in India on 17 May 2020,"Convenient and easy setup. Can be controlled from app. Wireless coverage is great and this router also has the ability to switch your band from 2.4GHz to 5GHz depending on the range and signal, without any manual intervention. I use it especially for its AP mode which works great with my BSNL connection (which has an Alphion ONT which doesn't support bridge mode). Definitely the best bang for your buck router out there."
B07GVR9TG7,AM,4.0 out of 5 stars,it's smart connect mode is super terrible and waste!,Reviewed in India on 9 January 2019,"it's smart connect mode is super terrible and waste!        even I was standing  very close to the router, still it was giving a vry low speed of 2.4GHz but later I turned off the smart mode and had to manually switch to 5GHz to get max speed, which means by default it keeps ur device in 2.4ghz only, in smart conect mode.        though it has 4ext and 1 int ant + Mu-Mimo still giving the same network strength as my old c6 dual-band router with 3 ext ant only & which does not has mu-mimo also.        conclusion: inspite of having 5 ant. its 5Ghz band can not reach properly to my bedroom, which is not far but hardly 6 feets from the router, which kept in my flat's passage area, which is also the center of our flat.        am very disappointed with all these gimmick with TP link plays with us."

And second things sometimes it's WDS doesn't work shows me WDS  as Assoc I don't know the meaning of it but when I got this status of wds then it won't work. For fix I trying rebooting it till it gets started working and Third thing is that when you use internet through WDS feature then it can pass internet to other devices but it can't use itself for remote managementor online management, for firmware update. I don't know why this happened. Fourth is that TP - Link doesn't have good customer care support system either on chatbot or on customer support number. I tried 20+ times to call them but only two times I get connected with them but no use of it because their voice is not clear to me    Note :- My network at that time is absolutely clear , I checked by calling somewhere else"

Archer C6 looks different.    Company is misleading with their claims like  300 Mbps speed at 2.4GHz and 867 Mbps speed at 5GHz.    I'm on 200mbps plan. The 2.4GHz gives max 50mbps only and 5MHz gives me full 200mbps speed where the maximum it can give is 700mbps and not more than that.    WiFi range is good.

B07GVR9TG7,Anoop,4.0 out of 5 stars,Range is not as expected,Reviewed in India on 5 February 2021,"My 10 Year old Netgear N300 still works like a charm! and has almost same range as this router (TP-Link Archer C7 AC1750 Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Cable Router). I purchased it expecting a better coverage in my medium sized home (1100 sq ft).        I live in a duplex home. The wifi coverage on the ground floor is same for both routers. However in one room on the first floor (above ground floor) the signal is very weak. With this purchase I was expecting a better wifi coverage on the first floor but I'm left disappointed as its just as good as my 10 Year old Netgear N300.        My only hope is when I upgrade my internet connection from 50 mbps to 100 mbps this new router would be compatible and do justice to the speed.        If you are looking for coverage on 2 floors in a medium sized home (1100 sq ft) this router may not be a good choice. Its maximum range is 2 floors, 2200 sq ft (1100 sq ft + 1100 sq ft). So if you need decent coverage you may have to spend some more money on a better router.        Some plus points now..        1) Super easy to setup (I have a PPPoe connection with ACT)    2) Network storage (1 usb)    3) Easy management with Tether app.    4) This router say's mesh ready (I haven't tried it yet)"
B07GVR9TG7,Prem,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for a single room. Bad across walls. Easy to use app. Looks good. 0,Reviewed in India on 5 October 2021,I ordered the Archer C6 and the first one that was delivered would not connect to PPPoE connection.    Returned it and got a replacement from Amazon promptly.    The second one connected to my PPPoE connection and was able to use it.    A little background on my requirements.    I have a Mi 3C router that has excellent range. I get good powerful wifi signals across the entire two storey bungalow and surroundings. The only problem was when more than 5 devices connected the wifi would start disconnecting on some devices.    I wanted to purchase a router that would provide good range but also maintain connections.    The Archer c6 was available at a good price and having used TPLink routers before I ordered this one expecting the same.    The wifi range is not great and across walls the signal is not as strong and in some places in the house I started getting dead spots.    The wifi is good within the same room or across windows but not across walls.    The tplink feature of smart connect that switches between 5G and 2.4G signal automatically is actually a pain.    Had to return it as it didn't serve my purpose.    Ordered a Linksys E5600 instead and it's working quite well.        Pros    - Price    - MI-MIMO    - Qualcomm CPU    - OneMesh support (for Mesh network setup)    - Good mobile app support        Cons    - Connecting to PPPoE networks is a hit or miss    - WiFi range is not great across walls. Don't order if you wish to use across multiple walls.    - Smart Connect feature is sometimes a pain as it tries to connect to a weaker signal and keeps frequently disconnecting.

In an open area this router has a good range but when it has to pass through walls the range is same as my old belkin router. If there is only 1 wall to pass through, the router is able to accomplish that but if it has to pass through 2 walls in case of multiple rooms then the network strength is very low.        Pros:    The router provides good download and upload speeds. No complaints there.    Looks good and is compact and lightweight.        Ethernet Cable and power adapter are included. Set up is easy."

But my secondary router which was MI 3c stopped working which was used as a repeater. I wanted a router which I could use as a repeater or as wifi extender with my existing tplink c20. This router doesn't have a straightforward mentioning about using it as a wifi repeater or extender but it does have the WDS capability.    It took me 15 mins to figure out where the WDS enabling option was situated, after that I tried to set it up as a repeater or extender and it took me 3 hours and believe me I thought I was a techie. It could be tricky to setup but after a good amount of googling I found a blog on the tplink website that explains about setting up WDS. It took some time, but finally things were up and running.    Performance is great , I could run full HD videos on 3 devices parallely. And even use 3 phones in parallel on a 43 Mbps speed 50 Mbps plan.    Works like a charm,, if you are someone who can setup things by yourself after googling stuff and are looking for running media on multiple devices parallely then go for it.    Or else buy a tplink c20 which is smooth as butter to setup using the mobile tether app."

This product had very nice reviews and great pricing as well.So trusted them and took a shot to go for it .I am glad to receive this in just 1 day and am loving it.This was super easy to setup via mobile app directly in very simple 2-3 steps (unlike others which need laptop or browser to configure via their ip based urls and need some technical knowledge or help as well ,which i had though). So this was up and running in 5 mins or less .Never imagined that it could be so simplified 😊👌        Now connection and performance,i stay in 2bhk home and connection is super and is giving me full bandwidth of the service provider in all devices (smart tv,smart bulb) laptops and mobiles ,ipads in each and every corner possible 🤘        This is a wonder gadget which fuel ed my home wifi like blessing.Just be aware that in this new gen (dual band router) you will see 2 wifi names after setup(one the name you selected and next name-5G).So connect to 2.4GHZ for getting access to remote corners (as this can penetrate walls etc better) else 5GHz which is faster (As long as you get this signal in corners too,if not connect to 2.4 GHz)        Loving it,go for it..!! Cheers"

Initially there where a few bugs which I had reported to TP-Link like not automatically connecting to ISP when using PPPoE settings as this was connected to my server and they had solved the same in 1.3.6 Build 20200902 rel.65591
B07GVR9TG7,Nilanjan Majumdar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Maxed out the maximum internet speeds !!,Reviewed in India on 30 September 2019,"I am writing this review after more than a year of purchase. I have a 75 Mbps plan from Vodafone-You broadband plan and this router is actually giving me upload and download speed more than 75 Mbps !.        The 5 Ghz mode works extremely well with my new google chromecast (Version 3) on my TV. It plays 4k HDR content like 'The Grand Tour' on Prime Video flawlessly.        If you're far from router, your device would connect automatically to 2.4 Ghz mode. Never has it disappointed me even once. I know the cost is on the higher side of an average router but it's a good investment in the age of work from home."

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Speeds and Sturdy Build but needs Software Improvements,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"Having burnt my fingers with a single band Mi Router 3C, I decided to double my budget and go for a decent router from a reputed brand. I have been using TP Link's Wifi adapter for years so it was a natural choice. Eventually I settled for the C6 as the A6 offered no additional features and C80 and higher had a significantly higher price.        Anyhow this is my initial review, which I will update if anything changes -        Build - Decent Quality. It's entirely plastic but looks durable. The shiny top surface is a finger magnet but then you won't be handling your router everyday. It is very light and can be balanced on narrow surfaces. Antennas are sturdy and maintain position if the router is moved or shaken quickly.        Rating - 5/5        Setup - A bit tricky, this one. I'm on a Static IP FTTH connection so I assumed juet inputing values (IP, Gateway, Subnet, etc) will do the trick. However, it did not. Had to call up customer care and they asked me to change the Primary DNS. From experience I believe there was a MAC lock involved which they unlocked during the call but I can't be sure. Anyway it took about an hour and half to set every thing up. This isn't TP-LINK's fault.        What is their fault is that MAC spoofing doesn't seem to work. So if your ISP isn't responding you may be stuck.        Rating - 4/5        Range and Signal Strength - Both are miles ahead of my 3C. I have a three storied house with thick 45-year old brick walls. Even on the third storey (with router on the ground floor) I could get a signal. Not possible with my 3c. Of course it's the 2.4GHz one and not 5Ghz but it's there.        Speed wise 5GHz is the king snd everyone knows that. Within the room and in the next room it works pretty good. Beyond that 2.4GHz seems to work well.        One grouse I have is that ""Smart"" Connection isn't good. Smart allows your device to connect based on the connection that gets the highest speed in that range. But with Smart on my adapter (from the same brand) gave miserable 560Kbps speeds on a 130Mbps connection. This with the adapter stuck to the computer on which the router was placed.        Separating the two bands by turning off Smart resulted in a huge improvement. 2.4GHz gives up to 80 Mbps in the same room while 5Ghz gives the full 130Mbps. One floor above I get 30-40Mbps. On the second floor it falls to 10-12Mbps.        So the antenna and radio are great, but the software needs to be improved.        Rating - 4/5        Bells and Whistles - The router boasts of MU-MIMO and beam forming. Turning the former on improved my connection speed and stability by around 5-10% on the ground and first floors. Beyond that no noticeable difference could be felt.        Haven't tried other features like VPN etc.        Rating - 5/5        Conclusion - Compared to the 3C this router actually allows me to enjoy the FTTH speeds I pay for. The hardware is impeccable and sturdy. The software is useful but needs some back end tweaking in the ""Smart"" department. That aside it's one of the most VFM routers under 3K for anyone with a 100Mbps connection or higher.        Overall Rating - 4.5/5"
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Serious bandwidth issue due to bad firmware. No Fix from TP-Link is available yet for this version.,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"I bought this router back in March of 2020 and I have been using it since and at the time this router looked good on paper and I have been using a Older TP-Link router for past 3 yrs so I went ahead and bought it. This router is the (US) version which amazon is selling in India. At first, the router was working well. I didn't experience any speed related issue on WIFI or on LAN.        There was some connectivity issues on CSGO (using LAN) but I thought it was a problem from ISPs end. But later, I found out the router was causing instability. After few months or constant observation, I came to the conclusion that my router was causing the issue this whole time and after a few searches online it was obvious that I was not the only one having the issue. I did contact TP-Link support and they fail to solve the problem. I did update the firmware to version 1.1.17 (20201010) but the issue is still present.        My ISP provides - 100MBPS (Download)/ 50MBPS (Upload)        Router gives 17mbps download and fails the test later. Mostly It can't even complete the speed test.        Rebooting the router fixes the issue for 5-10mins maybe sometime for more time but the issues persists to this day. I have also heard that they fixed that issue in (EU) version. But amazon is shipping (US) version in India so no luck there either. There is no DD-WRT support yet for this version (TP-LINK Archer C6 AC1200) so the last thing you can do is send this to the warehouse in MUMBAI and wait until TP-LINK send a replacement and Pray that works fine.        PS: Don't fall for the specs the issues are real and makes the router completely useless."
B07GVR9TG7,Ari,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Reviewed in India on 27 August 2020,"Update: I am revising my review for this product. TP link released a new firware after few months and on updating the latest firmware the router is working good for past few months. The overall experience of using this router is good. Now I can recommend buying this product.        Update: after 3 months the router is abruptly freezing from time to time and I am not able to connect any device to the wifi network. Only after I reboot I am able to reconnect to wifi network. Tp link India support centre have no clue what's wrong. Don't buy this product there is a flaw in this product.        Initial review after buying:    Good product with USB port, beamfoarming in AC and gigabit Ethernet. Range is ok."
B07GVR9TG7,Abhishek Chaudhary,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Poor Performing High End Tp Link Router,Reviewed in India on 4 January 2021,"This product is beast when it comes to specifications but it offers very poor wifi performance. Speeds drops consistently , Poor wifi signal ( Not even reaching to 1st floor ). Firmware issue and Tp link usually provides updates rarely. Even after modification of settings by Tp link customer support via remote link there was no improvement. Even Ethernet speed issue with this product. High Price very less performance. Think twice before buying it. Many be if Tp link releases hardware version 2.0 it may be good. Amazon as usual fast delivery and returning item because of poor performance ( may also be defective product )."
B07GVR9TG7,Soumya Banerjee,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product,Reviewed in India on 22 October 2017,I brought this product as I need a router that could support high speed internet connectivity. The router stopped working after a month. When I contacted Amazon they said that they (Amazon) cannot do anything as the return window had closed. I was asked to contact TP-Link. The customer care put me on hold. After waiting for almost 45 minutes I called again the same thing was repeated. I also send an email to TP-Link. But I just got an automated answer saying that my complain has been registered and they (TP_link) will look into the matter soon. I waited for their response but nothing happened for a couple of days. Then I posted my grievance on their Facebook as well as Twiter accounts.  This worked and I got a reply after five days of continuously chasing TP-Link on various mediums.    Now I have been asked to courier the router to their warehouse. Thay will look into the matter only after they receive it at their ware house.    Lesson learnt  - buy a product only if a local dealer is available.
B07GVR9TG7,KK909,1.0 out of 5 stars,Best VFM Router,Reviewed in India on 11 November 2018,I thought of getting a mesh system but they were too expensive so went with this and one reapeater setup. A few key points I would like to highlight are listed below:        1. The single USB port can be used to connect a powered hub and connect multiple HDDs and printers. It cannot provide power to all the connected devices thats why I said a powered USB hub. I tested it with a 750GB HDD alone and it worked without the need to external power.        2. The app for the router does let you see the client connected over internet as well but it is not a full fledged cloud router and you cannot use IFTTT for any kind of notifications.        I will not comment too much on range as that is too much dependent on you home and placement of the router but it is definitely better than old Netgear DGND3700 for sure and its 5Ghz band is specifically much more powerful than my old router.
B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beauty and the Beast!!!!,Reviewed in India on 30 May 2021,"This is a great product.    I have been using this for over 2 weeks now and really never had to bother about my wifi speed during this time.    I have an ACT fibernet connection, which delivers 150 mbps broadband.    With this dual band router i always get full speed on 5GHz and approximately 50mbps if connected to 2GHz frequency.    It can pretty easily cover 2,3 Bhk homes if placed centrally. Even works considerably for a floor above and below. But signal strength washes away if you ho beyond. THAT IS FINE.        Usage:    We usually connect 2 Mobiles, 2 laptops, 1 FullHd tv streaming Netflix etc and 1 echo dot with fluid ,stable connection.    There is no buffering in Tv while playing any online content.    My major concern with old router was while working over VPN as that demands really stable connection (Less speed is fine but it shouldn't flicker), now i don't notice a difference if i m connected to ethernet or on wifi.        It would be cherry on top if one USB port was provided, thats ok i guess since i had no specific use case for it. Unless you want to create a local NAS kind of stuff.        And thanks amazon for great delivery and price.!!!!        Update:    I added ""TP-Link RE300 AC1200 Mesh Wi-Fi Range Extender"" about a year back with this router and the results are brilliant as hoped.    Router is placed centrally in the apartment but signal strength would drop around corners. Placing extender there helps."

B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,This review is about the TP-WR902AC Travel Router (Do not confuse with other routers here),Reviewed in India on 24 February 2020,"First of all - please get this fact right. The seller has placed multiple routers in a single ad. The Star ratings that you see is an aggregate of all the routers. Therefore, let me first clarify that this review is about the TP-WR902AC Travel Router. Seller has put so many routers on the same page either inadvertently - or deliberately. Either way, it misleads customers.        When you start to set up the router, it asks whether you want to configure this as a ""3G/4G Router"" or as a ""Wireless Router"". One of my uploaded images clearly shows ""3G/4G USB"" written beside the USB port. If you are seeing Q&A to understand this router, you will have seen some answers saying that there is no USB port. If you have been to the Q&A section, I am sure you are as confused as I was.        Not only does this router have a USB port - the port serves a dual purpose.    *  In 3G/4G mode, this is where you connect the dongle    *  In Wireless Router mode, this accepts an external USB which can be accessed by your devices with proper configuration. I have added a screenshot for this too - showing my external USB disk partitions as sda1 and sda2        Configuration is easy - my son (12th std) got to work on a router for the first time and he did it in minutes. Both 5 GHz and 2.4GHz WiFi working excellently (Yes - you will have two WiFi signals from this one, as the AC suffix suggests)        If you configure this as a repeater, you will experience loss of speed (as with ALL repeaters - something which I explained in my review of the Netgear EX3110 extender ... search for ASIN: ""B07B1B2CZT""). However, in my case I pulled a LAN cable from my main router to this one. This makes it simple to connect - just select ""dynamic IP"" and your router is connected. I get ISP speed and hence happy about it.        Just beside the ethernet connector, there is a switch to select whether you want to share ethernet, share a hotspot or create an Access Point.        Signals are very strong (as expected, the 2.4GHz gives higher range while 5GHz gives better Signal-Noise ratio). The 2.4 GHz is reaching a third room about 20 feet away - penetrating two walls. So yes - the signal is good.        Three dampeners why I gave one star less:    1.  Cable is just about 1 foot long (see image). Now *that* is cost cutting. I had to use an extension board to be able to place it on the table. Plug point is just about a metre higher. Wonder how much profit TP Link is making by saving the cable length !!    2.  The MiniUSB charging port is a bit inside - therefore every miniUSB charging cable may not be suitable (it will keep falling off). To get a proper one, you need to see and compare the sizes to buy the longest (This one needs an additional 1mm to fit properly). This is not the only device with this issue - and there are many cables easily available - only you need to physically search for it. Online purchases may not work.    3.  This does *NOT* accept third party software. dd-wrt definitely is incompatilbe. OpenWRT includes this under their compatible routers list, but their forum says they lose the 5GHz band. Also - no clarity whether OpenWRT will support the 3G/4G mode. However, the OEM firmware is great in itself offer many options to use. So I suggest you stick to it.        The hardware version I got was TL-WR902AC v3 00000001 which probably uses a Mediatek card. The preloaded firmware was 0.9.1 0.2 v008a.0 Build 191209 Rel.57116n(5553). When I tried to upgrade from the India site, it said incompatible firmware and when I googled more to realize that this is probably a US firmware. I tried to upgrade to the US firmware and was told that the router already already the latest, so no changes made here.        SUMMARY    Pros:  Ethernet input, Dual-purpose USB, 3G/4G support and rock solid dual-band signals in a pocket-sized package costing less than ₹ 2000 ... I guess that speaks volumes to help you decide.    Cons:  Short power cable (1 foot) and no compatibility with dd-wrt or OpenWRT made me reduce one star.        I felt that this is truly what it claims to be - a powerful travel router with 3G/4G mode available."

Range sometime fluctuate but can leave with it.    if you want to upgrade from your 150mbps router then you can purchase.You need to place in middle of the house so that you get range in every corner (3BHK).    If place in any last room you will struggle for single.
B07GVR9TG7,Safeer Ahmed,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bit disappointing in 2.4ghz,Reviewed in India on 13 February 2021,"The router has a very good build quality and UI.    USB Port works as intended.    I'm disappointed with 2.4ghz speeds. It maxes out at 42mbps download. But Upload is good.    The range is ok not that impressive. just a bit better than TP-Link TR841n. If you have the latter one, don't upgrade if u want 2.4 GHz one.    Coming to the 5GHz network, the range is good for its frequency but you should be in the same room to use its full bandwidth.    This router is not made to share wifi between different floors. You will not get signals above or below its altitude.    This router has Remote access controls which I like very much.    This router is not best in anything. Maybe I should have gone with Archer c6 router(Same price - 4 antennas)"
B07GVR9TG7,mayur,4.0 out of 5 stars,Super speedy router,Reviewed in India on 7 July 2020,"I'm not an expert in networking. But basically before I had single band router for ACT fibernet connection. They advised me to upgrade to dual band router. I could literally feel the difference in speed after upgrade. It's a worth buying product.        Below review is only for WiFi mode. I haven't tested Ethernet connection. But I believe, it will also be fast and reliable.        5Ghz band is super awesome and the speed is getting without any latency. Good one for smart TV and gaming.        2.4GHz is also good. But quite congested. It doesn't mean poor connection. I'm getting a reliable speed. Many times it reaches it's max speed without lag. Best for mobile, and general Browsing in laptop and computers.        About setup. Using the setup guide or the installation wizard in mobile app you can setup everything in like 5 minutes.        Overall it's a worth piece. You can find the speed test results in screenshots"
B07GVR9TG7,Suhail,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy. Firmware is abandonware,Reviewed in India on 16 November 2019,"I bought this in October 2020. It is an okay router at the price point. Occasionally the internet stops working and I have to reboot the router for that to be fixed.        But here is the thing, you won't get any firmware update.        It so happens the one I purchased was Archer c6 v2. WPA3 support is in v3. Is there any price difference between v2 and v3? Nope. Will they upgrade the firmware for v2 as it is essentially the same hardware? Nope.        So, basically you are buying for few months worth of upgrade when they come up with a new version.        Better to go with a better brand like D-Link or Netgear."

The other 2.4 Ghz band can not reach beyond 2 walls or barely reaches in best possible condition. I need to reboot the router every 2-3 days to work. The Biggest letdown with this router is NO bandwidth control option!! I was looking for my first dual band router for my FTTH connection and after researching on Internet and YouTuber's recommendation I bought this one. Initial setup and other things are good. mobile app provides easy access to router setting, this all good but NO Bandwidth control, I'M regretting my purchase.

B07GVR9TG7,Sumit,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good product overall!,Reviewed in India on 2 November 2021,"Have been using this product for 4 months now. The dual band works well to my 2 bedroom and a huge hall. Signal strength drops sometimes if I am away by 30ft but no speed drop observed.        The 5G band is supported by my POCO M2 pro and my office laptop MacBook Pro 2017 but not by my hp laptop (it's 5 years old, can't blame it)        I play COD a lot and haven't observed unnecessary delay. Download speeds with ACT come to 3-5 MBPS with the basic plan. Haven't tested for other plans. When speed testing with Okla mobile app, shows 50mbps/50mbps. I don't really understand the speed test apps when I actually get only 5mbps download speed.        It was a good deal and a good product overall.    Amazon delivery and support as flawless as it could get - the one thing that keeps me hooked to Amazon."
B07GVR9TG7,Kachru,3.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect WiFi Router for you,Reviewed in India on 22 December 2020,I'm more than happy with my Archer C6 Router.

As I said I'm more than happy with the product and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good router. It clearly deserves a 5 star rating. As far as technical support is concerned I have not yet had to contact them for any issue and hope they would help if the need arise.
B07GVR9TG7,Raju G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,TP Link Archer C6(US) - WIFI clients loose the internet connection,Reviewed in India on 16 April 2021,"Recently bought the TP Link Archer C6(US)  Hardware version 3.2. This router is good when you consider the speed alone. Wifi devices configured in this router loose the internet connection at random time, and to regain the internet you have to restart the router. Interesting thing is that your device 1 may be working fine with internet connectivity but at the same time device2 shows no internet. This is discussed extensively in the TP Link forum in this header ""Archer c6 ""no internet access"" and sometime not connecting to the wifi saying ""limited connection"".  Seems to be a firmware issue, but loosing the internet connection in middle of an office call is not a good choice (with the fact that the internet connection is still present but the router just denied it for some of the  wifi clients)"

B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,What a Beast !!!,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"It was time to replace my dlink n300 router as it had started playing up. Changed to C6 after contemplating and comparing a lot of models. Models which were in the race were Tenda ac1200 and Tplink c1200 along with Tplink c5.    (1) Tenda's interface seems to be buggy with a lot of spelling errors and lack of good after sales support as per the reviews tilted the scale in Tplink favour. Among the three listed models, this one seems to be the latest and a hot favourite of a lot of online reviewers. Hence, a decision was made.        (2) The setup was a breeze. Took me literally 2-4 minutes to set it up and it was blazing away. The companion app is an amazing add-on .        (3) Mi-mo is an advanced technology which helps if you have a lot of devices trying to connect with the router.        (4) It is a dual band router. Remember that 2 ghz offers you great range but slower speed and 5 ghz has amazing speed but low  coverage range. I have a 75 Mbps connection. On a wireless connection, I am getting 45 Mbps on 2.4 ghz and 70 Mbps on 5 ghz, if I'm sitting close to the router. The speed does decrease a little in the next room but barely noteable. Now comes the best part , I'm getting full signal bars on 5 ghz in my bedroom which is approx 20 feet away from the router. I have connected my bedroom firetv on 5 ghz and now able to play 4k resolution videos without buffering pauses. To give you an example - i was able to download Asphalt 9 which is 1.82 gb on my One plus 6t in about 7 minutes i think. My entire house is covered well with either of the two bands. Full marks on this !        (5) Delivery was a breeze . Received the router within a day.        Conclusion- Go for it without a doubt if you have an above 50 Mbps connection and want a good speed with amazing coverage. It was my first day and i am 200% satisfied with the performance. Will need to gauge it's performance over a period of time to see how it fares.    Please upvote if my review was of some help to you."

I Upgraded to this Router from Dlink Dir-816 upon the suggestion from BSNL. Now i'm getting full 60mbps both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. The range is also very good. Even in weakest point of the home i.e after crossing 4-5 walls and a floor, i'm getting 30mbps on this router where previously getting 2mbps on Dlink. It also has gigabit port. It supports speeds above 100mbps.    Overall a good router with awesome range and speeds. Worth the money."
B07GVR9TG7,Saq,5.0 out of 5 stars,TP-link and customer support/ warranty are antonyms.,Reviewed in India on 8 December 2019,"I ordered this router the first thing after amazon started delivering post lockdown. The product performed well. Delivered the mentioned speed and has a decent (if not better) coverage area. Enough to suffice a sub 1800 sq. feet apartment (Walls and objects impact greatly). If however, your house is bigger, I recommend a higher power router.        In my case, the router just stopped working one fine evening and the Customer Support is so damn pathetic, every time I call them, it takes me 20 min to connect to a Customer Care Rep when I register for warranty related issues. When I do, I have to explain them the whole thing with details every single time (no, they do not keep a record), after which they say they'll send you a mail but somehow always forget to. It's been more than 10 days and 4 calls. No responce. Egregious service!        In conclusion, please buy a product from a company who gives a damn about their customers.    (Pst pst, D-link)"

B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not give good connection,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,Does NOT do its job. 2.4 Ghz connection completely unstable.    I am getting range of about 2 signals in a bedroome that is around 30 feet away from the router but no internet. Otherwise the 5ghz one is giving fine speeds. But I did not expect the 2.4 ghz connection to have drops and I am experiencing some drops in the network from time to time. The MIMO is not clearly visible.        Very bad router. No range in the next room. Completely useless. Not once am I able to stream video content hotstar/netflix etc. I am using an old single band router.        Edit1 :    This is bullshit from amazon. adding the reviews of many tp link routers together. Confusing the consumers into buying bad products.

Completely different product from C6 and it's written on box also it's C6. Tho in actuals this product resembles A6...    I had ordered C6.  But what I got is a product which is A6 in look wise. Totally confused with this mystery. Returning it .        Tho I tried to install it., But speeds aren't upto mark. Supports one mesh that's written on box., may be coz of which speed at 2.4Ghz is v poor.        Don't Buy. Not recommended. They will send a completely different product which isn't a oh la la product 😂        Update : 1.03.21    returned and received the same model again ..    To solve the mystery i opened Tplink webpage .    what i have been send is C6 Ver 3.20 . design is exactly same to A6. This doesn't support Mu- Mimo although its written on box that it supports. Instead it supports One mesh which i guess isn't helpful to many people unless you have a  existing mesh device already installed.    what they have displayed here in C6 Ver 2.0 but they are no longer selling it ( only old stock)         i will not recommend this C6 Ver 3.20. speed are vary .. in 2.4Ghz it drops to 15 mbps even if you are just 1 feet away from router. in 5Ghz it works good .. my plan to 150 Mbps and it reaches easily to 140 Mbps .    decide accordingly .

B07GVR9TG7,Ankush,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great router for plans 750 Mbps or less and home area is 1200 sq.ft or less,Reviewed in India on 26 February 2021,"Before I describe the router and its benefits I need to describe our home and it’s area and also the Internet plan we have. We live in a 2 BHK apartment with approx 1200 sq ft and have lived here for 4 years. When we moved in we took an ACT incredible plan with 150Mbps download speed which ACT then upgraded to ACT lightning plan with 250 Mbps free of cost a year later and now we have ACT advance received as a free upgrade almost a year ago. This one is supposed to give us about 400 Mbps but we have only been receiving 150 to 170 Mbps around about. So I understood that I need a router upgrade from my old D-link dual band to another, and that’s  when I found out about Archer C6. After reading and watching reviews comparing it to A6 and Tenda AC10, and also consulting with our ACT technician I decided to go for the C6. It’s been 10 days and it’s been a better streaming, downloading and WFH experience throughout the home.    Though the C6 has dual bands, you can set to autodetect the faster band depending on your location of in your home.  For us, we found out that C6 covers the entire home with the 5G band itself as I could receive approximately 300 Mbps in the living room and 200 Mbps in the bedroom next to it and about 100 to 170 Mbps in our Master bedroom and the bathroom attached which are behind 2 walls. And when I tested the 2.4 G Hz in these farthest locations, it only gave me 5 to 15Mbps which means if this band has to give me better speed , I had to farther away i.e I need to step out of my apt and walk the corridor towards the elevator and check if the 2.4 G Hz works there. But that’s a curiosity for another day but I hope this helped youunderstand the range this router gives and also with the MU-MIMO technology, my wife and I aren’t complaining about signal loss to each other anymore.    After this upgrade I also understood that that I need to ask ACT to upgrade the RJ45 cable that connects from the wall. That will help us boost the signal to another 50 tom70 Mbps which will take our speed to about 370Mbps and this router is very much capable of that since since its top speed in 5G is up to 867 Mbps and 2.4 G is up to 300.    P.S: please have the router connected through a UPS and not directly to the power source since power fluctuations and outages are common in India, the ups protects the router and helps us have a seamless work/browsing experience when the apt changes the power source to “backup power” when there is power outage in your area"

I bought this because I am a gamer and I have a connection with speed upto 500mbps. All in all if you have connection speed over 100mbps I would suggest this.

TP link support do not have clue on resolution, their forum is full of this issue. emails and support calls (which I been following up daily since last one month) has not given any hope of resolution. TP Link India support phone disconnects very frequently.    Wonder how TPLink has released this model without necessary testing and fixing bugs. This Model is a waste of Money.. Please read all recent reviews and posts before you buy..        Update On 16-03-2021    Updated the firmware of the router to beta version as recommended by their support. The firmware has not resolved the problem but rather restricts/throttles the upload speed by more than 50%, making playing games on PS4 a buffering experience and disconnects on 2.4 GHZ continues. surprisingly the log does not mention any critical alerts that the router has stopped responding. I have switched back to my old trusted D-Link rotuer DIR-850L. Also note for RMA, TP link does not provide home pickup, their support centers are very few and may need few Hrs of travel and returning the product, requires you to be bear one way cost. My recommendations given earlier still stands- Stay Away"

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,4 Antenna and many bugs,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"My experience with this router is very poor. Firstly the signal strength of the router is not as great as it is made out to be in most of the reviews. I bought this router to replace my perfectly working Netgear WNDR 3700 series router which did not have MIMO and beam forming but otherwise had b/g/n and only had an internal antenna with USB support.        The signal from this router does not go much further than my older router despite having 4 antenna and beam forming.        Many of my IoT devices and a couple of Raspberry Pi which worked flawlessly with my Netgear 3700 router simply cannot connect to this router for no apparent reason and they work in the 2.4Ghz band so it should have been perfectly compatible.        My Dell Laptop which used to connect flawlessly with the WNDR every time now mostly does not connect automatically and I have to manually connect it.        This router has a buggy firmware for sure even though it has the latest firmware and is c6 v 3.2        When connecting to any internal device using SSH, the keystrokes take time to appear! I had never experienced this with the Netgear.        Note that this router is NOT compatible with dd-wrt open source firmware, so you are stuck with the TPLink software and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.        Overall I think this router is really poor if you are a professional who has many devices and many protocols. It may work fine for average users, which explains the misleading number of positive reviews.        I've finally decided to disconnect it and use my original Net Gear WNDR 3700 again. This device is hopeless.        Update on 24/6/2021    Despite calling their ""Customer Support"" 8 times in the last 4 days, there is no response. The customer service phone number is a call center where they understand NOTHING. You basically tell them and repeat about 5 times. Then they promise an engineer will call you within 24 hours and now after 72 hours and 8 calls there is still no call. Their explanation is that they call from Avaya and not by normal phone so something is wrong.        ABSOLUTE FRUSTRATION."
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value for money, highly recommended.",Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"This was an upgrade from the Linksys E900 router. The dual band 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz certainly makes a big difference as compared to the single band E900.        For reference, I'm currently on the 75 Mbps plan from ACT.        With the E900, my maximum download speed was topping off at 60 Mbps. However, with the upgrade in place, I'm now getting a consistent 70+ Mbps at all times (the speeds with the E900 used to fluctuate a lot).        Range too, is pretty good on this router. Do bear in mind, however, that the range will take a substantial hit when connected to the 5 GHz  WiFi as compared to the 2.4 GHz.        For those of you who're new to dual band WiFi routers like me, note that this will broadcast two separate SSIDs, one for each band, depending on which your speed and range will vary.        The setup process was an absolute breeze. Simply plug in the power and the internet cable and connect to either of the SSIDs using the password printed on the underside of the router on a computer or smartphone (computer is recommended) and open up your browser. The configuration page should open automatically. Follow the steps and you're good to go in no time. You could also download the Tether app available for Android and iOS devices for changing settings and monitoring the list of connected devices on the fly.        Go for it, it's well worth your money."
B07GVR9TG7,Haddock,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Does all the essentials right, and works well.",Reviewed in India on 11 June 2021,It does everything I need it to do.

Setup is very easy and the mobile app helps for easy monitoring. I have had no issues in the few months that I have owned this router and is more reliable than other routers in this price bracket.

B07GVR9TG7,Nakul Rattan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jio Fiber Users Must Read This,Reviewed in India on 21 April 2018,Writing this to help Jio Fiber Customers. I have an apartment of approx 2400 Sqft. I have a Jio Home Gateway installed in my drawing room and i was using it to do my office work from the bedroom. (Approx 30ft apart) . Neither 5Ghz band worked nor 2.5 Ghz        The wifi signal from Jio there was pathetic.I purchased a range extender from TP Link RE 300 to extend the wifi signal. It didn’t help. I had to use 4G every day to connect to my office. The signal from extender was full but Jio Home Gateway and Range Extender were not working properly together. Connection between Range Extender and Jio Home Gateway kept dropping and i was suffering a lot.        I ordered this router and I’m very happy and satisfied with the purchase. I turned off Wifi signal from Jio Home Gateway and connected this router by Lan Cable to Jio Gateway        Now this router and my range extender do wonders! No more conference call drops and internet disconnections!        I recommend this router for people like me. This made me realise how terrible Jio Home Gateway is in terms of Wifi coverage (both 2.4 and 5ghz bands)
B07GVR9TG7,Peet,1.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty 2.4 ghz chip or firmware,Reviewed in India on 5 January 2019,"It seems to have a faulty 2.4 ghz chip mostly and not the firmware side. Because people have been facing this problem with all their typse of router as per a post on their forum. I am experience frequent disconnect on the device which tries to connect on 2.4 ghz and it works when device reboot. I have few IoT devices which does not support 5 ghz. Sad that the day i am writing the review a day before return period is over exchange is not possible now. To soon to get such hardware failure.        Update:    I just removed the stock firmware and installed OpenWrt and open source networking framework for routers. And problem is solved. So, i was correct it was only the firmware issue not the hardware. which a brand like tp-link not able to solve, sad. I would still suggest stay away from it. I wonder if i every will be able to buy tp-link router again."
B07GVR9TG7,Xyz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got a Defective Product,Reviewed in India on 31 October 2020,"I've been using TP-Link Routers at home and work for quite some time now, however since I upgraded my net speed to 100mbps I had to get one these so-called Giga Routers. Like in the past I assumed this would also be a Set-up and forget about it like all the others before it.    Once the set up was done I could log-on to the net for exactly 2 mins before the Router would REBOOT! Thought it might have been a 1-time anomaly or might have been something wrong with the connection.    Got the connection check, replaced it one of my old TP-Link Routers and it was working fine.    I wasn't getting the Full Range and Bandwith I was getting with the Giga router but at least it was rebooting involuntarily every few minutes.    After checking everything else I concluded that there was an issue with the router I received.    I checked Online and turns out some of the other users of this same C1200 model were facing the same issues as well. None of them could find a solution.        I have returned this Router ... It might have been one of those 1 in 100 defective piece or there might some an issue with this model an not sure which. However, I would recommend anyone buying this model to check for this issue on the day they receive the package.        Please Note I have reordered another model of TP-Link Router and am hoping that doesn't have the same issue."
B07GVR9TG7,Rizwan Ansari,1.0 out of 5 stars,Most Appropriate and Worth Buying,Reviewed in India on 22 June 2020,"Have purchased this router recently. I have a 175 Mbps connection at home and did some tests.        Within a radius of 7 meters it was giving following download speeds on 5 Ghz upto 160 Mbps, 2.4 Ghz upto 95 Mbps        I tried also for a 12 meter radius and got the following speeds on 5 Ghz upto 120 Mbps and on 2.4 Ghz upto 85 Mbps.        Have also tried for a 20 meter radius and found that the 2.4 Ghz was giving a speed upto 15 Mbps. So in all the wi-fi signal range is also reasonable.        The upload speeds I am getting is between 90-95 Mbps on 5 GHz and 70-80 Mbps on 2.4 Ghz        It takes around 1.5 mins to boot when switched on. Has a really Premium look.        I received the version 3.2 which is the latest one and as exactly shown currently on the amazon site and also on the tp link official site.        The router was delivered the very next day as promised and the packaging was also very good.        So far so good. Enjoying working with this router which is really helping with very less loss of signal and reasonable range and would definitely recommend to others."
B07GVR9TG7,Varun Gathani,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Few ups and few downs, but worth for the amount I spent (Archer C7)",Reviewed in India on 23 February 2020,"(Archer C7)    Works as expected. First the processor was always at 100%, but later it's normal. Router bottom is always warm.        I've bought this router for better Wi-Fi coverage, a good NAS, to be able to flash custom firmware like DD-WRT.        Well, Wi-Fi coverage is always sub-par compared with other routers, so don't expect great Wi-Fi coverage like Netgear/asus. But it's decent. It has mesh feature with compatible extenders, but I'm living in a medium sized home and WiFi covers almost all places. It has an option to merge both 2.4 and 5GHz networks with single SSID, so that router will manage which type of network you need based on distance from router. NAS have both FTP and Samba protocols, but both don't work so easily. I Always face issues with Samba. File transfer speeds in 5GHz signal is Max 2 to 3 MBps, some times constant 500 to 600 kbps, don't know why the big variation. FTP always works, but can't transfer multiple files at once as it's protocol limitation. Planned to flash DD-WRT, but so far the router working good, using more than 20 devices, no networking issues, showing real time performance and logs are accurate and don't want to give up Alexa integration with router. So, I've postponed the custom firmware flashing.        Final verdict: it's worth for the amount I paid (₹4,500)."
B07GVR9TG7,Sanjoy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prepare for a volley of firmware problems, specification dissapointments and zero technical support.",Reviewed in India on 17 May 2021,"Does its job OK. Good hardware for the price.        But currently there are massive firmware problems for this device that lead to WiFi problems, especially on the 2.4 GHz network that make it unusable in many cases. Check the TP-Link forums before buying. So unless you want to get your hands dirty and test every bit of functionality and become TP-Link's QA department, go for something that's plug and play. Technical support will not help you with anything beyond a standard set of solutions. Their phone support has abysmal wait times.        5 GHz radio only supports bands 36,40,44 and 48. So if you have multiple TP-Link Archer C6s with some configured as APs in your network, 5 GHz can operate only at a 20 MHz channel width. This is not mentioned anywhere on their product page. Also, the WebUI says 5 GHz is broadcasting at 20 MHz, but its actually putting out an 80 MHz signal, which in my case means unusability due to interference between 3 APs. Email support hasn't got back to me in a week, and they are ignoring my emails.        Also, no ethernet backhaul for these devices. OneMesh is wireless backhaul and works only with a TP-Link router as master and a TP-Link range extender as slave. So if you plan on using multiple router units to enhance coverage at your home/office (some in AP mode), WiFi roaming is managed on the client device. There will be no intelligent hand-off between different APs.        TL;DR : Too many firmware issues. Non-existent technical support, even if you provide them with detailed testing data. Specifications not as advertised. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!"

MU-MIMO technology is really great while multiple devices are connected as it gives equal frequency to all devices. Also you can set the priority device.        Dual band is also a plus point of it. You can simply shift the guest network on 2.4 gHz and the personal network on 5 gHz to get the seemless speed.

Was receiving full speed (sometimes a little more with nat boost) on both bands. Now, I am on 100mbps internet. Getting almost full speed on the 5GHz band. But the range of 5GHz is not that great (maybe similar compare to other same price range routers). It covers my home first floor around 1000sq.ft but there is no 5GHz signal on the 2nd floor. 2.4GHz band works well considering its range. I even receive enough signal to the second floor, in every corner. But I was getting around 50-60mbps only in this band. Disabling Nat boost did the trick- now it's going up to 85-90Mbps. Restarting router takes around a min. The cloud option works well. Also have not experienced any kind of lag or hang. Have not checked USB connectivity. So far, a good purchase."

That also sometimes range drops and speed drops to 10 to 20 mbps.        It is only when it connects to 5 GHz then it gives 100 mbps but when it claims that on 2.4 GHz speeds May go upto 350 MBPS then why we should get only 50 mbps. Even standing close to the router on 2.4 GHz speed will not cross 50 mbps.        Returning it.

B07GVR9TG7,Deepesh M Divakaran,5.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY: Weak coverage & several issues with frequent internet cuts,Reviewed in India on 3 July 2020,"The build & specs are good BUT that's it!!        There are frequent Internet cuts and its not with the service provider as I have 2 NETGEAR routers and they work perfectly fine on the same connection but this router keeps having frequent Internet cuts (you can see the system logs with more than 1000 entries for a day).        Just google TP Link Archer C1200 router rebooting issue and you will see this is a known issue with most high-end TP Link routers. TP-Link tech support isn't able to find a fix yet.        I have stopped using this router now & using my old NETGEAR routers. Highly disappointed with TP-Link.        Coming to the after sales support, that is equally bad. Just check their web page and you will realize they do not have a good after sales support. I sent more than 3 emails to the support group but no response. Telephone calls are not answered and you are endlessly in teh queue which automatically gets disconnected after waiting for 15-20 mins        Overall a very disappointing experience which left me with money wasted on a product that i dont use  any longer."
B07GVR9TG7,Ranjith Coapullai,5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful Wifi Router 🔥🖤,Reviewed in India on 4 March 2020,"This wifi is the best for a gigabyte supported speed in a very efficient budget . This came with a proper sealed packaging and was a raw and new piece . This wifi gives a powerful signal strength even if you have a bunglow . But for floors you have to buy a range extender for it . Though the speed is so fast for this wifi but the real speed depends on the internet package you select from your ISP ( Internet Service Provider ) . Because the marketing of internet service works in a different way . For eg : If you selected a package of 100 mbps then you will get the download speed of 100 : 8 ratio , which is 100 ÷ 8 = 12.5 mbps speed . So dont get confused . This ookla and other speed checkers just show your bandwith range speed than your real download speed . Thanks me later first thanks to amazon for making this wifi available for us in a very efficient cost . Its market price ( offline store ) is more than 2800 Rs/- ."

Where other routers have this feature where my Rs 799 router has this feature. As per the support team, they mentioned that this feature is not available in TP link. The 2.4 ghz not working properly. After every 2 hour I have to restart the router to work 2.4ghz properly.        Apart from that the admin panel is not well described. Bit alow when changing some settings. And it has only replacement policy not return is applicable. Waster Rs. 2.5K on bad router. Also, speed getting dropped for continuous using. The CPU is getting high when more than 6 device are connected. Better to go with other router. I thought I'll buy AC-4000, but thank God that I bought cheaper one to get know about its inner side. Never ever again will go for TP Link. 😟😭😔"
B07GVR9TG7,Aakash,4.0 out of 5 stars,Use it only as Primary router  or immediate router next to your ISP's router,Reviewed in India on 4 May 2020,"Pros :    1. All features as expected , this model have two versions on TP link website , i have received v3 as part of delivery.    1. Speed on duel band as expected.    2. Easy to setup and in v3 version LEDs are placed in such a way that they dont interfare with view.        Cons:    This can not be used in big netwrok setup , let me explain    1. I have my primary router by my ISP(airtel) which is duel bank Nokia router and I am extending the wifi courage using LAN port of that router i.e usin it as secondary router, so when my setup is Primary Nokia router---->LAN output conection----> TP link archer A6 , then all works fine , whenpower goes on primary or there is some issue with ISP side , then as soon as power comes or connectivity is back , then this TP link router also comes online without any issue.        But if i use it as thirst router , so setup is :  Primary Nokia router----->LAN connection--->Another TP link router or SWITCH------> LAN output from switch/second router----> TP link archer A6 ,    In above setup , this works well when you setup , but if power goes or there is even short time outage from ISP and when power comes back , then this router never comes online .    I always have to reboot it to get it online , though IP address , subnet etc are all fine and shows as expected.    Firmwaye is already latest.        This issue is in both router & accep point mode , I also tried manually assining IP within subnet range  but that also doest help , and as soon as power goes or primary / secondary router is down for a second , this one never comes back without reboot.        Thus If you have a huge setup or multi floor house or many other routers , this can only be used as primary or just imidiate secondary to ISP provided router , otherwise you will have to restart it every now and then."
B07GVR9TG7,Subhajit sarkar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheapest and the most feature rich router in this segment.,Reviewed in India on 30 November 2020,"Bought 2 of them back to back. Wait and watch and you may catch a deal up to INR 2249.    Reliable and easy to setup. You can pretty much just forget about it after the initial setup. Has everything you could wish for as a home user.        Nit picks :    1) A mobile friendly UI for management or a dedicated app (which actually works) would have been nice.    2) One-Mesh feature should be enabled between 2 routers. Bought the second one hoping it would work but sadly it doesn't.        Tip:    - DO NOT sign up with tp-link account for the app. Provides no features at all. Web management has it all.        Overall:    If you want a reliable router and have a budget of upto 3500-4000, go for this one. It punches way above it's weight class.    If you can spend a bit more then going for ASUS maybe a better choice for their robust AI Mesh system, better UI and monitoring, app support and better performance in general."

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Good router for a medium to large sized home,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,This router was delivered pretty Quickly and in an amazing condition without any damage. I chose this Router over the Netgear R6350 coz i had a really bad experience with the products that i received. As soon as i opened the case i noticed the router was packaged pretty well so i plugged all the ports and power connections and turned it on ... I got the TP link Tether app and must say that its really good .. i didn't experience any issues with the product and within 5 mins i was connected to the internet... Its got a really good coverage area for its wifi signal. Also the 5ghz band is helpful for newer devices to use a higher internet speed without cross interference if u living in a apartment or if u have a lot of Wifi signals in ur coverage since it broadcasts the signal at a different frequency than the common 2.4ghz but it only used for a lesser range compared to the 2.4g signal. Im overall happy with this product.

With the tether app, it was a smooth installation process for someone like me who is not very proficient at such things. I did it on my own!

B07GVR9TG7,Ashish,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressive.  Technical review,Reviewed in India on 7 June 2018,"This is one of the worst purchase, it is not as powerful as compare to my small digisol.  In today's age we need extensive security functions but it lacks even basics.  Parental function are just ok.  It does not have good log level to understand traffic in details and block it.  IP/Port traffic details is a must, you do not know which device/app connect to unwanted sites.  It is expensive and doesn't live upto expectation.  With this feature it is better to buy low budget router.  Lastly as on date 25/11/2021, this is not in supported list of OpenWRT    Wireless class  : AC1200    Series  : Archer C1200    CPU1  : Broadcom BCM47189B0    Hardware Version  : Archer C1200 v3.0"
B07GVR9TG7,Kiran,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Range and product restarting automatically multiple times in a day,Reviewed in India on 30 October 2021,"I really do not understand why there is no return option rather it is a replacement option. It is hardly not even 3 weeks and the router is getting frequently restarted. Daily it restarts 5-6 times without anything and it creates problems in my daily meetings/work, childs daily school due to disconnection issues. Luckily I had my old router so my work and other things are not disturbed else due to this replacement policy it would have impacted me a lot. Ideally replacement policy should be like take back old and deliver new at the same time so it doesn't impact people specially in this current situation where everything is work frm home and online    Also the range is very less. I have the router in my hall of 950sq.ft home and there is no range in any of my bedrooms which is about 20-25 feets of distance. Really not at happy as of now."

Apart From That, Gets The Job Done",Reviewed in India on 25 November 2021,"I bought this for future proofing only, could have gone for a cheaper version.    Its Admin Console is GUI based and is very user friendly. That can also be accessed via. TP Link App on Android.    I chose this because of 2 major reasons-    1. 5GHz Band (For Future Proofing)    2. Four Gigabit Ethernet Ports (For Max Local File Transfer Speeds & Least Latency in casual LAN Gaming at this budget)        I was having a DSL based BSNL router before this, So when I switched ISP, I had to buy one with RJ-45 Internet IN port.        I am using this from 26 August 2018. Only con I noticed was that it reboots randomly sometimes (rare it is but this issue is present). I suspect that it could be related to its overheating. Not sure.        Apart from that it is a good product. One can also look for its NetGear alternative. But this one is good too."

I read that wifi boosters tend to reduce the wifi speed by almost half & decided to try this instead. It has not affected my wifi signal speed or bandwidth in the least bit. Now my Firestick shows a very good signal strength & my movies stream perfectly. Well worth the cost as a booster & if my original router fails I have an instant back up ready as well.

Using archer c6 V3. 2 in router mode made no difference to the wifi signal strength which i was receiving with syrotech, very disappointing. Moreover since this the new version V3. 2 it has firmware issues wifi signal drops and comes back intermittently which is very annoying hope this issue is resolved soon by tp link. If you are considering to buy this router on reviews please reconsider this product is wrongly overrated.    Currently i am regretting my decision to go with tp link    Edit- After july2021  firmware update C6 is performing good giving stable wifi .But If ur considering buying router in this price range go for Linksys E5600 which regularly goes on sale for 2700 rs    It also has EASY MESH support which can create a mesh network with another linksys E5600 or other Easy mesh compatible router from another company. Tp link does not offer this great feature ,it is just trying to sell mesh extenders .    These days of fiber connections speed ranging from 100 -300 mbs ,mesh network of routers is a absolute necessity to get full speed in every corner of house."
B07GVR9TG7,Arun Sharma,1.0 out of 5 stars,For 2500 Rs you deserve better than this router.,Reviewed in India on 12 December 2020,"Appario might send you a used item. Be warned!        Model: Archer C6 V2 (EU)        This router supports only  the band 1 on 5GHz frequency.        Everytime the router reboots it will reset the bandwith of 5GHz frequency to 80MHz. So everytime the router boots up you have to switch to 40MHz manually. I was told by the TP-Link India customer support to set the bandwidth to auto instead of 80MHz. On Auto mode the bandwith on router was always set to 80MHz which I don't want.        Firmware is simply laggy, takes 3 seconds to load a menu on the Router management Page.        Router emits 2 hidden WiFi that you have no control over ( this hidden wifi is used for OneMesh). Even if you disable the Wireless radio for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio the hidden network will still be enabled. A TP-Link representative said that this is by design. However, I'm pretty sure that TP-Link added an option to disable it on it's other higher-end  Router.        All the problems that I have mentioned here were posted on TP-Link's community forum so check it out to see if these problems were fixed.        Many have complained of unstable 2.4Hz WiFi radio being unstable and that their device were disconnected from the WiFi. I didn't face this issue because I don't use 2.4GHz."

The wall penetration is adequate but not as good as 👉""Tenda A10"". Mine is a 100Mbps connection and following are the speed results;    ---------------------------------------------------------------    5Ghz  - Same room, 104Mbps up & dwn. After a wall, (4-5m) no range!    (to get the max 5Ghz speeds, disable the 'auto band switching' to manual in the router settings)    2.5Ghz- Same room, 30-45Mbps up & dwn. After a wall or two, 15-25Mbps up &dwn.    ---------------------------------------------------------------    The rage of 2.4Ghz is good after 3 walls but the speeds are terrible.  After many reviews and articles, I found that among Tenda A10, Archer C6 and Archer C60, the TP-Link Archer C60 is the best performer. But the problem with TP-Link Archer C60 that, it has no gigabit port.        👉 If the connection speed is 100Mbps or more, gigabit ports are needed. Even in a 100Mbps connection, the speeds are limited to around 90Mbps without the gigabit port. 👈        I got two of these C6 modem and both are terrible with video calls. Constant disconnection!! Returned both of them and got Tenda AC10. Now everything works perfectly. Tenda AC10 also have the 2.4Ghz slow speed issue.

B07GVR9TG7,Muralikrishna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Poor 2.4Ghz performance and range,Reviewed in India on 8 August 2019,Archer C6 takes 2-3 minutes to boot up in comparison to 20-30 seconds of my 7 year old 150Mbps single antenna Dlink DIR-600L router. Idk why this Qualcomm chipset is that slower than that old router.    I've a fiber 60 Mbps plan. I place router next to window not a bricked wall so that signal spreads better.    On 5Ghz Archer C6 gives great 58/59 Mbps speed but for 12 feet circle. While on 2.4Ghz I was getting poor 30Mbps download and pathetic 12Mbps uploading sitting next to router and 6-8 Mbps on the next to next room of same floor (24 feet). I tested a lot of times. In comparison my old Dlink router gives both 30-45 Mbps upload and download speed for 10-12 feet circle and 6-8 on 24 feet distance.    I've tried to reset Archer C6 thrice and changed different settings but poor 2.4Ghz performance remain the same. Also the range is pretty average on 2.4Ghz. I couldn't even connect on the floor above with both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz frequency.        Overall these 4 external long antennas are like tusks of elephant. Just for show not of much use. Buy this only for great 5Ghz performance of your fiber plans. But alas! these 5Ghz routers range is quite lower than 2.4Ghz. I suggest 5Ghz extenders for more range.

This is just insane (i have subscribed 50Mbps FTTH Connection from a local ISP),    Their service is pretty good but the problem was i would never achieve 100% speeds as promised after complaining them they forced me to upgrade my Router from D-link 600M to this TP-Link Archer C1200 & Ohh my God this is just insanely fast. When i do a speedtest i get 50Mbps download & this is slightly fluctuating for around 2-3%. The 5g bandwidth provides blazing speeds but less range & 2.5g bandwidth provides decent Range but less speeds. this gigabit router doesn't mind if you're wirelessly connected or over LAN the speeds are always damn good.        The Router Setup was fairly good (for non-technically ones, it'll be damn good experience) through the Application.    also the features are pretty impressive.

Hence I won't recommend anyone to buy this router as its totally unuseful in all manners"
B07GVR9TG7,T SANTOSH BABA,1.0 out of 5 stars,Frequent Disconnect- every 1-2 hrs,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2019,"My experience with this router is not very exiting when i bought this. my intention to buy this was to replace old router which is still working.. but wanted to have better coverage in 3BHK flat. but i feel the coverage and signal strength is same a my old router (5 yrs old).  just that i already bought it, so i started using it.        over the period of time. i have noticed that my Wifi gets disconnected  once in a day or 2... i mistook this to my ISP issue. but then the frequency kept increasing over a period of 4 months.  Now i have disconnect frequency of around 1-2 hrs once.. Though i have ""reconnect automatically"" enabled, i need to manually connect to Wifi.        Note: my old router still works flawlessly. only the speed is slow as it is not dual band and not gigabit."
B07GVR9TG7,SWAROOP KRISHNA PUNUGU,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ok,Reviewed in India on 17 September 2021,Received the product on time. Thanks Amazon for timely delivery but the product has left at security guard without any information.    The installation is very easy and I could connect it with help of my internet service provider. As mentioned by TP link about the wider coverage I could not found much difference as compared to my Older Miwifi 3C router. TP link is slightly better but the cost difference between those two is huge. Earlier I used to found one bedroom of my home is facing the connection issue due to wall now also I am facing the same issue because of which I have to start using my old router in repeater mode. I found slight improvement in lag time of my devices. Also the buffering is lower while I watch TV.    The app is very easy to use and I can control the router through app this is an advantage over Miwifi. Miwifi app is very worst and useless.    Overall it is OK purchase for me.
B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,A Beast for this price !!,Reviewed in India on 2 September 2021,"I've been using this for 4 months and so far didn't face any issues in the connectivity. As I have a 100 Mbps connection, the download and upload speeds are on the mark. The signal range is also pretty good and it can easily cover an area of up to 1000 sqft. The only CONS I have with this product is MU-MIMO technology. As per this technology, it has to have a better penetration power so that the signal can easily penetrate through walls and should provide lossless connectivity. But, I am not satisfied with this MIMO technology, as sometimes I face connectivity issues when I move from one room to another."
B07GVR9TG7,Reviewer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good router,Reviewed in India on 26 June 2021,This TP link Archer AC1200 Archer C6 purchased recently and installed.  the installation is very easy. It gives 5G speed when the router is placed near PC.  if we use Wi-Fi at another room then the speed comes down to 2.4 ghz. But what i noticed was my earlier router with 2.4 GHZ never get interrupted in between and gives constant.  But this router is getting fluctuate and signal getting interrupted and we need to login once again.        The speed is good compare to dlink 2.4 GHZ router but only if placed near by. With distance of 10 feet it shows lesser speed        Since only 15  days gone . Lets see in long run and comment on issue
B07GVR9TG7,Vinay Sai,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great router,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"I honestly didn't know how much better my wifi could be before I got this router. I was using a basic Mi 3C and the speed was absolutely terrible so I upgraded to the archer and the connection, speed, features it's all amazing. The USB port on the back is an absolute godsend. No more emailing files between my phone and laptop or worrying about the hassle of backing up my phone, I can just drag and drop onto it at lightning speeds. Thr wifi coverage is great on 2.4G, not so much on 5Ghz but that's more of a technology limitation of 5ghz. The 2.4ghz isn't as fast as I'd hoped but it works very well. This router is an absolute must buy, props to my internet guy for recommending it"
B07GVR9TG7,T S Rajendra Kumar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Issues with 2.4Ghz band on Archer C6 (read up on TP-LINK Forums before buying),Reviewed in India on 13 December 2021,"Consider buying another brand router. The 2.4Ghz WiFi band has a lot of signal drops and issues. Multiple firmware upgrades later it still exists. You can search it up on the TP-link forums. 2.4Ghz SSID just dissappears or you just can't connect to it, ip conflicts in DHCP mode and only solution is to restart the router again and again. Really frustrating!        That being said the 5Ghz band works consistently without any issues.        Also point to note is that even though this device supports One Mesh it doesn't mean you can buy another Archer C6 router and set up a mesh network. Read up more on it if that's your plan."

This router made a lot of difference from my older router (PRONET, abt 11 yrs old)    I can now connect 8-10 devices including Laptop/Phones and TV and internet works absolutely fine.    I have activated only 2.4Ghz band as Max speed on my ISP is 10 Mbps , so no point activating 5Ghz :)    Range is good, my home is 1000sft , and i get range till outside of my house and even on roof.    TP Link Tether  - Mobile app is awesome and you can manage your all settings thru mobile itself.    It gave a new life to my old DSL connection.

Totally guided by a friend of mine, was able to do it, though a few things he did connecting my laptop through internet, which I am not aware.        Seeing speeds never seen before.

B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Writing this review after 2 months usage,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"This is probably the best gigabyte budget router out there in the market and during Amazon sale the price usually drops by 200-300₹. If you're planning to buy, do look out for Amazon sale. The product is value for money and the 2.4Ghz range covers 99% of my 2 storey house. The 5Ghz range is decent (10-15 feet radius) depending on where you place the router. MU-MIMO is only supported by the 5GHz band. The connectivity is fast and can easily manage 5-6 devices at a time along with 3-4 devices streaming online content."

Range is not good,Reviewed in India on 19 October 2020,"The wifi range is lesser than my 2 antena ZTE Wifi router which I got it for free with My ISP. I don’t understand what is the use of 4 external antennas and one internal , may be just for show. If you want to upgrade for range this is not at all a good option.    The 5G band is the only upgrade I got, but the range is so bad for 5G . Just inside the room.    If you have an Internet connection with more than 50 mbps then only 5G band is of any use.    Amazon delivery packing and everything was very good."

The provided power supply and ethernet cables were pretty good too.    overall I love the product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a router in the 8-10k price bracket."
B07GVR9TG7,Jubish,3.0 out of 5 stars,Best router for home or making a mesh,Reviewed in India on 29 July 2020,"I have bought this model C1200, So what I like or not like about it,        Pros of this router    1) Same speed as my connection (50mbps).        2) Easy to setup, for mobile setup it's the easiest because everything is there in that app and need only your username or password(PPPoe) or a Static IP given by your ISP.    Who knows the advance stuff this router provide(Only experts can do the advance stuff).        3) There are options like:    a) Parental controls(sad for kids though),    b) QoS for bandwidth control(for limiting the data it goes to every device),    c) You can setup Guest connection (if you want that privacy and annoying your guest),    d) Blocked those annoyed person's internet(if you want),    e) Other stuff that experts only can use.        4) There is a USB port for connecting a pen drive or a hard drive if you want a network storage,    Or you can plug your printer to make it wireless(Best features for old printers or non Wireless printer).    Everything is automatically made by the interface, but you can tweak a little bit.        Cons of this router    1) Well it has both 2.4G and 5G at the same time, but it is limited to 10 devices at 2BHK,5 devices at 1BHK. You really REALLY need a mesh or other router of the same company to connect more devices.        2) Well if you go to the advance stuff, normal people will toggle the wrong settings, Really most of the things in advance mode is seriously configure, only use basic mode for less craziness.        3) It's USB 2.0, so don't expect those serious transfer rate like USB 3.0 or Type-C provides. But it's is nice to have this feature.        4) There is a TP-Link Cloud but it applies to home or office security and you have to pay for the cloud  storage(If you have or someone has experience).    Well lets buy a 2TB or 1TB hard drive and job done."

B07GVR9TG7,Mihir Gupta,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good route, great speed!",Reviewed in India on 27 March 2021,"It's the first time I ordered a router other than netgear. I have a 125 Mbps broadband connection, and wanted a router capable of delivering accurate speed more than the range coverage. After going through a lot of reviews, I ordered it. This router lives up to my expectations!    Having dual band, it delivers speeds upto 120 on 5Ghz. And about 80 on 2.4Ghz frequencies. Be advised that devices capable of receiving 5Ghz have a shorter wifi range when compared to the 2.4Ghz frequency.    Initial setup was fairly simple. However, unlike netgear, I couldn't find a firmware upgrade option. Only time will tell how good this router really is.    I received my package well within the scheduled time, so full marks to Amazon once again.    Finally, if you are paying for a broadband connection over and above 100 mbps, always use a dual frequency router with gigabit ports. Other routers are simply incapable of delivering high wifi speeds.    I recommend TP Link routers."

Used dlink router before which was giving aroud 20 feet range after closing metal door.    Overall good for indoor but signal range severely limited by walls and doors."
B07GVR9TG7,Amatul Haseeb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to install/Configure & Good quality plastic,Reviewed in India on 7 January 2021,"Wifi range and speed depends on band. This router supports both 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz bands. 2.4 is good for long range but slow speeds and inversely 5 Ghz is for high speed Internet and short ranges. No signal loss if connected to another router. All are gigabit ports so high transfer rates b/w two devices is possible. MU-MiMO handles seamless connections with multiple devices without any lags between them. Also, I liked the Configuration UI as it has both basic and advance UIs for beginners and Experts.        Overall good quality and worth the price."

Good    1 - The 2.4 GHz band has a good range, will cover nook and corner of your home.    2 - The device build quality is good, not heating up too much    3 - Provides good speed from your internet connection        Bad    1 - Here the problems start, you can't rely on the 2.4 GHz band, the device drops connections multiple times a day when connected to this band, and will show that there is no internet. But the 5GHz band will be working normally at the same time.  I tried replacing the first Router that I bought but the second one is also showcasing the same problem    2 - 5 GHz band which works properly has very less range, don't expect anything solid beyond one wall.    3 - The advertised Mu-Mimo tech is not visible or prominent even when used with set preference, so that seems like just a gimmick.    4 - The smart switch feature available is also not that smart, it will not switch your device to the 5Ghz network when the 2.4 GHz networks stop working as I mentioned above.        If the situation is getting verse I might switch back to my NetGear router which was more reliable even though it is old and only supports 2.4 GHz band."

Few points to note:    1. WPA3 is not available to every client, they need manufacturer support. So set it to auto.    2. Alexa & google skills are just a gimmick they are useless    3. The router runs warmer than usual, idk why!    4. Ensure you get the V3.20 and not the V2.0 model... some reviewers complained of receiving the older one (Design is completely different & so are the features)    5.

B07GVR9TG7,Fayaz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent with heating issue (thus questionable life and performance in summers),Reviewed in India on 22 May 2021,"Signal - Excellent.    Setup- Not painful.    Looks - Big but good.        At idle, this router is very warm. This was placed on a flat table which is anything but crowded with no obstructions for airflow. The underside was close to hot and the top panel was very warm. Yet, signal was excellent and stable during these 30 C days in south India. However, heat is a very big concern for life of any electronics and add to that the average maximum temperatures in Summer which crossed 40C. I'm sure, it will have some kind of impact on signal stability and over-all life of this product. Got a replacement which had same issue, so I think it is a design limitation rather than unit defect. So, I guess, unless you have air conditioned rooms where you can install this, you may want to get something else doesn't heat up as much. I have read multiple reviews of products in this price range and except Netgear and Dlink 825 don't seem to have heat complaint. So, choose wisely and I hope we get better choices in this price range."

B07GVR9TG7,ar.ramkrish,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review after 1year of use. It now supports Onemesh !!,Reviewed in India on 15 December 2019,"Have been using this router for a year and have not faced any issues with it till date. Range is better than other routers (had tested Tenda router) to cover 1000sq ft apartment through 3 walls !! Only in the last room where the signal is too weak I use a TPLink Wifi extender 305 which supports both 2.4 and 5Hz band. That too has been working good for the past year.        UPDATE:- After a recent firmware update on the router and the extender 305 , the devices now support Tplinks ONEMESH interface..... The advantages of Onemesh are:-    1) No video or call drop while moving between router and extender signal, all through the video remains clear.. :)    2) The wifi extender 305 quick setup is even more quicker now as it takes the setting from router and no additional settings are to be made in it    3) The 2.4 and 5Hz band can be merged into one and the router/extender will emit only one SSID. Depending on the speed requirement and signal strength your device (smartphone/tablet/laptop) will automatically switch between them.    4) Low Cost!! No need to spend more money on the expensive wifi mesh routers from google or Links when your existing system can be turned into a mesh system at comparatively cheap price...     Google ""Tplinks ONEMESH wifi devices"" to see the products which support it... :)        FINAL NOTE:- once you update all your devices, you need to run through the quick setup on your router and then on the extender again for smooth operation."

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Speeds and Sturdy Build but needs Software Improvements,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"Having burnt my fingers with a single band Mi Router 3C, I decided to double my budget and go for a decent router from a reputed brand. I have been using TP Link's Wifi adapter for years so it was a natural choice. Eventually I settled for the C6 as the A6 offered no additional features and C80 and higher had a significantly higher price.        Anyhow this is my initial review, which I will update if anything changes -        Build - Decent Quality. It's entirely plastic but looks durable. The shiny top surface is a finger magnet but then you won't be handling your router everyday. It is very light and can be balanced on narrow surfaces. Antennas are sturdy and maintain position if the router is moved or shaken quickly.        Rating - 5/5        Setup - A bit tricky, this one. I'm on a Static IP FTTH connection so I assumed juet inputing values (IP, Gateway, Subnet, etc) will do the trick. However, it did not. Had to call up customer care and they asked me to change the Primary DNS. From experience I believe there was a MAC lock involved which they unlocked during the call but I can't be sure. Anyway it took about an hour and half to set every thing up. This isn't TP-LINK's fault.        What is their fault is that MAC spoofing doesn't seem to work. So if your ISP isn't responding you may be stuck.        Rating - 4/5        Range and Signal Strength - Both are miles ahead of my 3C. I have a three storied house with thick 45-year old brick walls. Even on the third storey (with router on the ground floor) I could get a signal. Not possible with my 3c. Of course it's the 2.4GHz one and not 5Ghz but it's there.        Speed wise 5GHz is the king snd everyone knows that. Within the room and in the next room it works pretty good. Beyond that 2.4GHz seems to work well.        One grouse I have is that ""Smart"" Connection isn't good. Smart allows your device to connect based on the connection that gets the highest speed in that range. But with Smart on my adapter (from the same brand) gave miserable 560Kbps speeds on a 130Mbps connection. This with the adapter stuck to the computer on which the router was placed.        Separating the two bands by turning off Smart resulted in a huge improvement. 2.4GHz gives up to 80 Mbps in the same room while 5Ghz gives the full 130Mbps. One floor above I get 30-40Mbps. On the second floor it falls to 10-12Mbps.        So the antenna and radio are great, but the software needs to be improved.        Rating - 4/5        Bells and Whistles - The router boasts of MU-MIMO and beam forming. Turning the former on improved my connection speed and stability by around 5-10% on the ground and first floors. Beyond that no noticeable difference could be felt.        Haven't tried other features like VPN etc.        Rating - 5/5        Conclusion - Compared to the 3C this router actually allows me to enjoy the FTTH speeds I pay for. The hardware is impeccable and sturdy. The software is useful but needs some back end tweaking in the ""Smart"" department. That aside it's one of the most VFM routers under 3K for anyone with a 100Mbps connection or higher.        Overall Rating - 4.5/5"
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Serious bandwidth issue due to bad firmware. No Fix from TP-Link is available yet for this version.,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"I bought this router back in March of 2020 and I have been using it since and at the time this router looked good on paper and I have been using a Older TP-Link router for past 3 yrs so I went ahead and bought it. This router is the (US) version which amazon is selling in India. At first, the router was working well. I didn't experience any speed related issue on WIFI or on LAN.        There was some connectivity issues on CSGO (using LAN) but I thought it was a problem from ISPs end. But later, I found out the router was causing instability. After few months or constant observation, I came to the conclusion that my router was causing the issue this whole time and after a few searches online it was obvious that I was not the only one having the issue. I did contact TP-Link support and they fail to solve the problem. I did update the firmware to version 1.1.17 (20201010) but the issue is still present.        My ISP provides - 100MBPS (Download)/ 50MBPS (Upload)        Router gives 17mbps download and fails the test later. Mostly It can't even complete the speed test.        Rebooting the router fixes the issue for 5-10mins maybe sometime for more time but the issues persists to this day. I have also heard that they fixed that issue in (EU) version. But amazon is shipping (US) version in India so no luck there either. There is no DD-WRT support yet for this version (TP-LINK Archer C6 AC1200) so the last thing you can do is send this to the warehouse in MUMBAI and wait until TP-LINK send a replacement and Pray that works fine.        PS: Don't fall for the specs the issues are real and makes the router completely useless."
B07GVR9TG7,Ari,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Reviewed in India on 27 August 2020,"Update: I am revising my review for this product. TP link released a new firware after few months and on updating the latest firmware the router is working good for past few months. The overall experience of using this router is good. Now I can recommend buying this product.        Update: after 3 months the router is abruptly freezing from time to time and I am not able to connect any device to the wifi network. Only after I reboot I am able to reconnect to wifi network. Tp link India support centre have no clue what's wrong. Don't buy this product there is a flaw in this product.        Initial review after buying:    Good product with USB port, beamfoarming in AC and gigabit Ethernet. Range is ok."
B07GVR9TG7,Abhishek Chaudhary,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Poor Performing High End Tp Link Router,Reviewed in India on 4 January 2021,"This product is beast when it comes to specifications but it offers very poor wifi performance. Speeds drops consistently , Poor wifi signal ( Not even reaching to 1st floor ). Firmware issue and Tp link usually provides updates rarely. Even after modification of settings by Tp link customer support via remote link there was no improvement. Even Ethernet speed issue with this product. High Price very less performance. Think twice before buying it. Many be if Tp link releases hardware version 2.0 it may be good. Amazon as usual fast delivery and returning item because of poor performance ( may also be defective product )."
B07GVR9TG7,Soumya Banerjee,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product,Reviewed in India on 22 October 2017,I brought this product as I need a router that could support high speed internet connectivity. The router stopped working after a month. When I contacted Amazon they said that they (Amazon) cannot do anything as the return window had closed. I was asked to contact TP-Link. The customer care put me on hold. After waiting for almost 45 minutes I called again the same thing was repeated. I also send an email to TP-Link. But I just got an automated answer saying that my complain has been registered and they (TP_link) will look into the matter soon. I waited for their response but nothing happened for a couple of days. Then I posted my grievance on their Facebook as well as Twiter accounts.  This worked and I got a reply after five days of continuously chasing TP-Link on various mediums.    Now I have been asked to courier the router to their warehouse. Thay will look into the matter only after they receive it at their ware house.    Lesson learnt  - buy a product only if a local dealer is available.
B07GVR9TG7,KK909,1.0 out of 5 stars,Best VFM Router,Reviewed in India on 11 November 2018,I thought of getting a mesh system but they were too expensive so went with this and one reapeater setup. A few key points I would like to highlight are listed below:        1. The single USB port can be used to connect a powered hub and connect multiple HDDs and printers. It cannot provide power to all the connected devices thats why I said a powered USB hub. I tested it with a 750GB HDD alone and it worked without the need to external power.        2. The app for the router does let you see the client connected over internet as well but it is not a full fledged cloud router and you cannot use IFTTT for any kind of notifications.        I will not comment too much on range as that is too much dependent on you home and placement of the router but it is definitely better than old Netgear DGND3700 for sure and its 5Ghz band is specifically much more powerful than my old router.
B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beauty and the Beast!!!!,Reviewed in India on 30 May 2021,"This is a great product.    I have been using this for over 2 weeks now and really never had to bother about my wifi speed during this time.    I have an ACT fibernet connection, which delivers 150 mbps broadband.    With this dual band router i always get full speed on 5GHz and approximately 50mbps if connected to 2GHz frequency.    It can pretty easily cover 2,3 Bhk homes if placed centrally. Even works considerably for a floor above and below. But signal strength washes away if you ho beyond. THAT IS FINE.        Usage:    We usually connect 2 Mobiles, 2 laptops, 1 FullHd tv streaming Netflix etc and 1 echo dot with fluid ,stable connection.    There is no buffering in Tv while playing any online content.    My major concern with old router was while working over VPN as that demands really stable connection (Less speed is fine but it shouldn't flicker), now i don't notice a difference if i m connected to ethernet or on wifi.        It would be cherry on top if one USB port was provided, thats ok i guess since i had no specific use case for it. Unless you want to create a local NAS kind of stuff.        And thanks amazon for great delivery and price.!!!!        Update:    I added ""TP-Link RE300 AC1200 Mesh Wi-Fi Range Extender"" about a year back with this router and the results are brilliant as hoped.    Router is placed centrally in the apartment but signal strength would drop around corners. Placing extender there helps."

B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,This review is about the TP-WR902AC Travel Router (Do not confuse with other routers here),Reviewed in India on 24 February 2020,"First of all - please get this fact right. The seller has placed multiple routers in a single ad. The Star ratings that you see is an aggregate of all the routers. Therefore, let me first clarify that this review is about the TP-WR902AC Travel Router. Seller has put so many routers on the same page either inadvertently - or deliberately. Either way, it misleads customers.        When you start to set up the router, it asks whether you want to configure this as a ""3G/4G Router"" or as a ""Wireless Router"". One of my uploaded images clearly shows ""3G/4G USB"" written beside the USB port. If you are seeing Q&A to understand this router, you will have seen some answers saying that there is no USB port. If you have been to the Q&A section, I am sure you are as confused as I was.        Not only does this router have a USB port - the port serves a dual purpose.    *  In 3G/4G mode, this is where you connect the dongle    *  In Wireless Router mode, this accepts an external USB which can be accessed by your devices with proper configuration. I have added a screenshot for this too - showing my external USB disk partitions as sda1 and sda2        Configuration is easy - my son (12th std) got to work on a router for the first time and he did it in minutes. Both 5 GHz and 2.4GHz WiFi working excellently (Yes - you will have two WiFi signals from this one, as the AC suffix suggests)        If you configure this as a repeater, you will experience loss of speed (as with ALL repeaters - something which I explained in my review of the Netgear EX3110 extender ... search for ASIN: ""B07B1B2CZT""). However, in my case I pulled a LAN cable from my main router to this one. This makes it simple to connect - just select ""dynamic IP"" and your router is connected. I get ISP speed and hence happy about it.        Just beside the ethernet connector, there is a switch to select whether you want to share ethernet, share a hotspot or create an Access Point.        Signals are very strong (as expected, the 2.4GHz gives higher range while 5GHz gives better Signal-Noise ratio). The 2.4 GHz is reaching a third room about 20 feet away - penetrating two walls. So yes - the signal is good.        Three dampeners why I gave one star less:    1.  Cable is just about 1 foot long (see image). Now *that* is cost cutting. I had to use an extension board to be able to place it on the table. Plug point is just about a metre higher. Wonder how much profit TP Link is making by saving the cable length !!    2.  The MiniUSB charging port is a bit inside - therefore every miniUSB charging cable may not be suitable (it will keep falling off). To get a proper one, you need to see and compare the sizes to buy the longest (This one needs an additional 1mm to fit properly). This is not the only device with this issue - and there are many cables easily available - only you need to physically search for it. Online purchases may not work.    3.  This does *NOT* accept third party software. dd-wrt definitely is incompatilbe. OpenWRT includes this under their compatible routers list, but their forum says they lose the 5GHz band. Also - no clarity whether OpenWRT will support the 3G/4G mode. However, the OEM firmware is great in itself offer many options to use. So I suggest you stick to it.        The hardware version I got was TL-WR902AC v3 00000001 which probably uses a Mediatek card. The preloaded firmware was 0.9.1 0.2 v008a.0 Build 191209 Rel.57116n(5553). When I tried to upgrade from the India site, it said incompatible firmware and when I googled more to realize that this is probably a US firmware. I tried to upgrade to the US firmware and was told that the router already already the latest, so no changes made here.        SUMMARY    Pros:  Ethernet input, Dual-purpose USB, 3G/4G support and rock solid dual-band signals in a pocket-sized package costing less than ₹ 2000 ... I guess that speaks volumes to help you decide.    Cons:  Short power cable (1 foot) and no compatibility with dd-wrt or OpenWRT made me reduce one star.        I felt that this is truly what it claims to be - a powerful travel router with 3G/4G mode available."

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy anything from TPLink  - you cannot reach anybody on the TollFree number,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"I purchased a TPLink C6 Archer modem about 6 months back - it had 3 years warranty. First couple of months it worked well and gave full speed of about 180Mbps. For last 3 weeks it is giving only 80 Mbps for some reason - unable to reach anyone from the Toll Free HelpDesk they have - even if you wait for 30 minutes you will repeatedly get only the standard music and nobody will attend.  They are hiding behind Corona situation and giving recorded message that all our engineers are busy and service levels are affected due to corona.  Literally I am stuck with this modem, unable to reach anyone, 10-days replacement window by Amazon is also expired. Not sure what to do.  Trying to reach them every day :-("
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Works well with ACT,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,"I bought this Archer C6 router to replace my existing DLINK router that maxed out at 100Mbps. I wanted to upgrade my ACT plan to a higher bandwidth plan and looked for Gigabit routers. This Archer C6 router supports 1Gbps speeds on all the LAN ports & the uplink WAN port. It also support Wireless across both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. This is one of the recommended routers from the ACT corp blog post. I got the router working within a few minutes with my ACT internet connection.        Initially, my desktop couldn't cross 100Mbps on speed test. After I replaced my existing ethernet cable with the one provided by TP-Link in the box, the speed goes upto 1Gbps."
B07GVR9TG7,Srinivasan R,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good dual band router,Reviewed in India on 24 August 2021,"This is a good dual band router. Earlier I was using 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands separately, but now I connected to smart connect. All my devices connect from all corners of my flat at the 5 GHz channel. Even though, I have a 300 MBPS connection. I get that on my desktop PC, which is connected to the router via the gigabit LAN port, but the devices connected through WiFi get around 200 to 250 MBPS. I am happy with that, as I don't see any delays or stuttering. I am regularly working from home due to pandemic and my son also does his online classes at the same time by my desktop all at the same time. The MIMO technology is a plus as per me. It really helps increase the speed of each connected devices and reduces delay to a significant amount.    Only downside is that the boot time is quite long and if rebooted, takes at least 3 to 4 minutes to come back online on WiFi and provide internet services.    I will recommend this router to others."

When I approach to get this replaced with another router with the different specification having 9DBI. I was refused and told that you will receive the same product as a replacement. It Was really sad to get the answer from Amazon customer care which have surprised me. Be careful when the product has given option replacement means you will get the same product as a replacement else you have to leave with the product which you are not satisfied.

B07GVR9TG7,Indranil Mukhopadhyay,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not great....of little use,Reviewed in India on 20 June 2021,Unfortunately I can't return this unit for refund since only replacements are entertained and will make no sense. My wired network provides 100Mbps but this router provides approximately 50Mbps ( 20 feet away from router) in 2.4Gz band and 90 Mbps in 5GHz band although checking speed standing close to router (5 feet) provides good speed of 90+ mbps. I called tplink tech support and did ask their recommendations and made changes accordingly but no improvement. I purchased this since the router provided by service provider was too providing wifi around 40mbps. Look for something better.. be aware the wifi signal significantly drops after 20 feet with little obstacles and donot penetrate through walls. This is best suited as wifi bridge say from first floor to ground floor.    Although the primary and this router need to be connected through Ethernet cable.. The cheaper version Tplink AC 750 is more than enough for the purpose which had similar dual band at less than half the price ... Higher price of this router is not justified !

I was having problems with my network and informed the provider. They checked and found that direct speed was great but router was slow. So I replaced my ten year old single band router with this new dual band router. My speed increased from 5mbps to 45 mbps. Also, Smart Connect and Onemesh features are great if you want to extend coverage through a wifi extender. In short, great router. Highly recommended. One suggestion - do hard reset the router using a pin before you setup and configure the router.  This will make sure that you get maximum speed."

Actually this device has no proper reviews or this was not used the way I am using it.        Range extender: Not recommended. This product description says, max speed for 5GH signal is 433 MBPS. When coming into reality it does not when you us it for the purpose of range extender. Its full waste of money for the extender purpose. It will not cover the range not even 100 sqft. So better buy the other model that only servers that purpose.        Now am stuck here as there is no return of this product and get fooled with the product description that it support my 300 MBPS line. Actual speed am getting when i am sitting next to that router is posted.        LAN will not re-connect when you use that one with the hot-spot. You have to re-start the modem."

For Mobiles - When connected on 5G WIFI, I get easily 280-290 MBPS. On 2G, always above 50-70 MBPS. Please Note - 5G is when your are closest to the router, and 2G is when you are far from the router. You will NOT get 5G connectivity if you are too far away from the router.

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product is Good  but .....!,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,I installed the FTTH broadband for some reason it is hanging in a day showing all is connected but no internet. I change the channel still happening the same. After Investigate more in detail device is configured right but needs to restart the router once a day. I  set up from the application itself restart every day after that all the function works smoothly.        Look like firmware needs to fix by the manufacture this is not the right option to reboot the device every day. Only the way it is fixed is firmware needs to fix the device stability.        Device cost is good if you were looking for a broadband router.  But I'm a friend of Cisco means Linksys those routers no need to reboot whole year work smooth as normal.

What i observed is that there was neither any increase in speed nor improvement in coverage. Infact wifi signal drops are now more frequent which even my wifi has noticed. My PC, which is hardly 5 feet from this wifi router is now dependant on a wired ethernet connection, the wifi signal is so poor and unreliable.    Called the customer care, and he too sounded like....""you should have asked before buying this wifi router""    I am looking at how do return this product and get my money back. Considering my experience, i suspect if all the other reviews for this product are genuine.        update:    even the wired connection is so poor that i get good internet speed from a direct cable connection from my modem , but no internet connection from the router which is connected to my modem"
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,The product is good as it is a dual band router.        1. It supports dual-band wi-fi (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz).    2. It has a USB port so you can connect different devices to the router and make them network accessible.    3. It has 4 LAN ports which are good for connectivity for a household.    4. The web user interface is somewhat easy and you can operate it with a little to no knowledge.    5. It has lots of control in the web app and in the mobile app to control your router.

Without disabling NAT BOOST the router delivers good speed.        After disabling it, I Enabled the QOS, that can be classified for three profiles: High, Medium & Low, under any profile you can't define particular bandwidth but can only assign in percentage of total incoming. Low profile can't go below 5%.        Now, going forward after setting it up, I am getting 50-60 Mbps on my 200mbps plan over 5G & 70 Mbps on LAN.        With just 4-5 device connected simultaneously on 5G band, the CPU load jumps to 70%.        On top of that the tech support is the worst story.        That's absurd."
B07GVR9TG7,pankaj,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent performance and should go for this one.,Reviewed in India on 29 January 2021,Using this from last 4 days and I am impressed by the performance. Corners of my apartment where no or very poor wifi signal was available now I get more than 40MBPS. With this router I am able to get the max bandwidth of my fiber connection and doesn't need to use ethernet cable. Installation is pretty simple and the app is user friendly. There are many features this router offers and overall this is a very good product.
B07GVR9TG7,Salam,4.0 out of 5 stars,This one works flawlessly as a range extender with JioFi 3,Reviewed in India on 22 May 2020,"Works flawlessly as a range extender with JioFi 3  when we select mode 2 in WDS modes. The default 'auto' mode and mode 1 have some compatibility issues with JioFi 3 but might work with other routers/modems.        The 2.5GHz signal is really strong. All in all, the best router at 2.7k INR especially because, as per my research, this one is the only router at this price range that has four gigabit LAN ports!"
B07GVR9TG7,Avinash T,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor Product,Reviewed in India on 4 July 2021,"Poor product, power adaptor spoiled in 4 months. original adaptor is not available in the service center and market. Only option to buy an unbranded adaptor. Unit failed in 8 months. Warranty can be claimed but not replacing only service. After claiming warranty i received a different unit (not mine) a sticker placed on it saying ""Refurbished Not For Sale."""
B07GVR9TG7,ratan veer,1.0 out of 5 stars,It’s just an above avg dual band router,Reviewed in India on 6 November 2021,"This is an average dual band router with an upgraded MIMO tech. No different from most routers. Considering it’s performance, I believe it is priced slightly on a higher side. WiFi signals are decent but not great. 5 GHz band signals are just avg. Reception is not as expected. Multi layering is as good as any ordinary router. Don’t go by the fancy content in the brand’s product description on AZ. If you want a regular dual-band router, then this is in the first line of available products along with others."
B07GVR9TG7,Amit Jain,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product,Reviewed in India on 28 May 2020,"Using for couple days, so far going good. My internet is 50 Mbps, getting full 50 Mbps upload and download using Google and ookla speedtest. Used 2.4 and 5ghz for main and guests users flowlessly. So far awesome experience.    _______    Now using for a month, going very well, no disconnection at all. I am using for WFH with continuous zoom meetings. Awsome router C6 AC1200 US V3.20, seller Appario.."
B07GVR9TG7,Aditya Naik,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works good but range isn't great.,Reviewed in India on 8 July 2019,"Range isn't as good as advertised atleast for 2.4 GHz. Had the same range of my old Netgear N300 router( disappointed).    Added advantage is the number of devices allowed without the drop in bandwidth. Connected 3 phones 3 tablets and a laptop, ran them simultaneously, streaming found no issues when close to the router.    5GHz is only useful when you are close by which is expected.    Works good, looks big but light weight (little close to being flimsy).    No connection drops (had this issue with my old router), didn't test for connection exceeding 100Mbps."
B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor range of 5GHZ, buy only if you spend most of the time in the same room",Reviewed in India on 23 August 2021,"1) V3 model received instead of V2, that is okay but V3 has a rough pattern that attracts dust and cannot be cleaned easily.    2) Auto switching between 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ networks, you don't have to do it manually, is an excellent feature.    3) Very poor range of 5Ghz, router switches to lower frequency as soon as u step more than 10 feet away, speed on 2.4Ghz is slower than my last 2.4Ghz TP Link router and this sucks.    4) TP link has updated OS for V3 routers and it is good looking but not very functional."

B07GVR9TG7,MARS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Router..Loving It..!!,Reviewed in India on 30 August 2021,"I have always been struggling to get speed from my internet connection. Although i am using a 100Mbps internet plan my earlier router were hardly giving me 50mbps that too when ur working close to the router. Have tried Belkin, Netgear and Even Mi router. Mi was the better one in the lot but still nothing more than 50Mbps.        After a lot of research took the risk of buying this dual band router and i must say it was worth taking the risk. I am now getting around 60Mbps on 2.4Ghz band and around 95 to sometimes even 100Mbps on 5 Ghz band. This is simply amazing. The router is awesome. Look wise also it looks very good. I am simply loving it. On my recommendation my friend has bought the same router and he is also very happy with the performance.        If your fedup with your single band router and not getting speed just upgrade to this router."
B07GVR9TG7,Hardy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Failed my expectations!,Reviewed in India on 30 June 2020,This router is a big fail to my upgrading plans. My wifi use to be much smoother and consistent over my previous roter of tp link with half the price. Signal keeps on disconnecting and take a long time to connect on 5ghz network. I am not sure if it's DHCP server problem or this router that ip address are assigned with a long delay.
B07GVR9TG7,parth,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good one,Reviewed in India on 7 March 2021,I had tp link 150N rauter with 100 Mbps speed connection. It was giving me around 30-40mbps speed so desided to switch to AC router and it worked wonders. With this I am getting speed of 95-98 Mbps.    One observation is that I had 5 year old HP mini desktop with only 2.4GHz receiver inbuilt. It started giving me issues of frequent speed loose.  But no other devise working on 2.4  or 5 GHz had this issues. So added to link archer wifi AC dongle to the HP mini and it's working gr8 now.
B07GVR9TG7,Sunit Kumar Borah,1.0 out of 5 stars,Flawless,Reviewed in India on 6 April 2018,Great product. Super easy setup. Provides signal much further than previous router (which was also TP link but only 2.4ghz). My previous router would often have to be reset and would not work with the wifi extender. This one sorted out all the problems. Now I'm consistently getting my 75mbps.

B07GVR9TG7,Madhuri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Speed and coverage but slow in startup,Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,"This is excellent router in terms of speed and range. I am paying for 75mbps internet and getting download and upload speed between 75-80 mbps in both wired and wireless network. So wireless speed is same as wired speed. Also coverage is good upto 2 walls in case of 5g band and 2.4g band is reachable to 3rd wall as well. It also giving excellent coverage and same 75mbps speed to second floor above the same room as router.    Only thing I don't like about router is, I found it slow during startup. Though I never need to shutdown or restart this router in one month since i am using it but when during setup when i restarted, it takes a while before coming online so if there is power cut, it will be offline till 1-2 minute even after power is back, else everything is good about this router.    For speed, I am deducting one star."
B07GVR9TG7,VPS,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Router stopped working, reveived a refubrished product",Reviewed in India on 9 July 2020,In 1 month the router stopped working after the continuous call center team responded with service center details. Courrier charges have to be paid by me but after 4 days I received a refurbished product instead it should be replaced with a new one or the old product should be repaired and should have sent to me.    Very disappointed with the TP-LINK service center and customer service.        Now a new issue the touter takes 10 mins to starts. TP LINK any solution to this

No matter how much your internet speed is above 100..it will cap your internet speed to 100Mbps.    I have tried all their solution. It doesn't work        Internet port negotiation speed setting is 1000Mbps full duplex but when checked it's showing 100Mbps full duplex.
B07GVR9TG7,Devika,5.0 out of 5 stars,not a  stable Router,Reviewed in India on 6 December 2020,"I would say this has been an investment that I am sure that i wldnt regret at all. Not only was the installation easy but the UI of the product' s app is easy to use as well. A well rounded wifi router by tp-link. No questions asked. The 2.4ghz gives me a range of 2storeys and speeds of 30-40mbps while the 5ghz attains speeds of 100mbps oit of my100mbps broadband plan. In these days of wokring fron home, this is an important accessory to have!!"
B07GVR9TG7,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,HORRIBLE PRODUCT AND REDICULOUS customer support,Reviewed in India on 27 October 2020,"Archer-5 has a much better feature than Archer-6. Apart from the additional internal antenna which is not visible the feature set are very poor.        After a long wait got an engineer on call.. Had to explain multiple times about the feature.. The engineer kept arguing the interface grouping is not available on  Archer-5 too while i have been using that feature.        I was supposed to get an call back in 8 hours after consulting there engineering team,  its been more than 4 days.. still no response"

B07GVR9TG7,Sameer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unstable Wifi, more features, Ver 3, RJ45 Connector, No Tech Supp.",Reviewed in India on 4 February 2021,I bought this product on 25th October 2020. It stopped working from 20 December 2020. I called customer service and they asked me to arrange another adapter from any electronic shop. I refused to do due to busy schedule and asked the service executive to send a technician as the product illustrates 3 years of warranty. But the technical executive said they can't help anymore. Why the hell this company promising 3 years of warranty when they can't fullfill. Waste of money on this REDICULOUS product
B07GVR9TG7,Akash Sharma,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stay away from this product - Wonder why I fell for this gimmicky Router !!!,Reviewed in India on 14 July 2019,"Had brought this router thinking it would be great addition to my house, but as it turns out, someone has tampered with it. Since it is a dual band(2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) I was expecting the same but the 5 GHz frequency wasn't operating. The password printed on the back of the router didn't match when I tried to login, had a very harrowing experience.        Had to manually reset it twice only then it worked.        Buyer beware!"
B07GVR9TG7,Ranabir Dasgupta,2.0 out of 5 stars,,Reviewed in India on 2 February 2021,"The Wifi signal gets jumbled up beyond 10 feet... The Irritating Smart Connect feature can't decide whether it wants 2.4G or 5G channel for your system which you are using...    AI is a bummer....    Tech support is non existent, found much better answers on Reddit....    Although the Tether App makes it easy to install...        Btw I bought Ver 2... Received Ver 3... Although both connect to RJ45... I guess Amazon forgot to update the little detail... Also delivery was in 1 day... Which is good... But 3PL distributor thought the Packaging can withstand a pounding by Godzilla, so received the out box banged up in some places...        Pro Tip: If you want good wifi stability, choose any one band either 2.4G or 5G otherwise, the router will start thinking it's Skynet and mess you up..."
B07GVR9TG7,Vinayak,1.0 out of 5 stars,,Reviewed in India on 20 June 2020,"Like any other Indian buyer, I was swayed away by following    - Cost ( Cheaper than its competitors )    - Looks ( 4 Antennas give a impression that its super strong)    - Product Reviews ( 6000 reviews, mostly 5 or 4 star)        Reality:    Looks are deceptive - These 4 antenna are just for show-off, I think there’s only one internal antenna that really works. Even if you remove other 3 antennas the signal strength remains the same.        Usefull - Naah.. my problem still remains, this Router is no better then D-Link 600 that I had earlier. Not a single bit improvement in the Wifi signal that I use to get in my house with D-Link.        Cost - I think people should not fell for Cost, a slightly costly one from Netgear is far superior than this toy. I borrowed a netgear router from my friend it worked like a charm and gave me far superior performance. I’m selling it on Olx, and will get a Netgear now.
